""The findings prompted officials to look for similar findings. CDC officials conducted a different analysis in the Vaccine Safety Datalink system, using the same data but different methodology, and were not able to replicate the finding. Officials also searched other systems, including those of Medicare, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Pfizer’s global surveillance network. Regulators in other countries, including Israel, also were consulted, but no evidence of similar findings emerged, the officials said.
The statement from the two agencies said that the government uses multiple systems to detect potential safety problems and that “often these safety systems detect signals that could be due to factors other than the vaccine itself.”

In a more neutral world where these things don’t get in the media, we publish the signal in order to get others to look for the signal in their own databases.

It’s amazing how many times a single database picks it up, but no pick ups anywhere else until 6 months after publishing .  Clinicians need to be aware - it seems a rather defensive release from the CDC - which I fully understand as to why, but still the cdc should ignore the gallery ( I really hate to say it - peanuts )

>reported 275 people who suffered a stroke **attributed** to the vaccine within 41 days, of those ~50% occurred within 48 hours after injection

It is deceptive to claim these strokes were ""attributed"" to the vaccine. The documents you link to do not say this. They are adverse events, which means they occurred after vaccination, but not necessarily caused by vaccination. The Pfizer documents cover a period of time where tens of millions of vaccine doses were administered. Unfortunately, everyday there are people who have strokes. And it's more likely among elderly people, who were a priority group for the early phases of the vaccine rollout (and who make up the majority of the reported adverse events.) There's only a safety signal if the number of adverse events is higher than the number of expected background events. There was no safety signal for this data.

You're inaccurately editorialising what that document reports.

The adverse events listed in that paper are *not* attributed to the vaccine. They were observed in the population of 126M administred doses within 90 days. Causality is not necessarily implied. In a population that large, you *are* going to observe the normal background rate of disease incidence.

About 56m people are aged over 65, and 550,000 is 1 / 102nd of that.

justgetoffmylawn,10bty8k,"I haven't seen those reports, but the math is more complex than that. Your math would be correct if the vaccines were 100% protective for those over 65. And of course the death rate for those over 65 from Covid is more than 0.1%. So we would need to examine the potential risk of a serious side effect, vs the overall *improvement* in all-cause mortality provided by the vaccine (something we unfortunately rarely measure, as all-cause is more important and less subject to arbitrary guidelines than specific 'acute Covid' outcomes).

I think your conclusion is still correct that for those over 65, the bivalent likely provides significantly more protection than risk, but it would be nice if more data were being collected. 

Singapore tends to be one of the better places for data collection (and has alerted people to the significantly elevated risk of death after the acute phase of Covid is over), but I wish other countries were doing better data collection (glances meaningfully at US CDC).",16,j4d527e,t1_j4d0jqt,2023-01-15 05:45:01
jdorje,10bty8k,"The potential risk of a serious side effect is included in the all-cause mortality.  The correct-ish way is to measure the all-cause death or hospitalization rate.  The issue with that is that the variance is so high that you need a really massive sample size.  In the middle half of 2021 this research was done and showed around half the all-cause mortality of those who were vaccinated.  But it wasn't repeated in 2022 that I have seen.

Even with all that there are still confounding factors that can break the analysis.  It's very easy to tie glasses-wearing to positive health outcomes for instance, but the causality on this is believed to go in the other direction: people with better education and healthcare are more likely to wear glasses.

People over 65 who got the bivalent were [0.06% less likely absolute](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#covidnet-hospitalizations-vaccination) to be hospitalized per month due to covid than those who were vaccinated but no booster (0.1% monthly hospitalization risk for non-bivalent, versus 0.04% with bivalent, versus 0.56% unvaccinated).  If OP's numbers of 0.02% for one month (I did not verify) is correct then the vaccine is slightly better over the one-month timeframe after vaccination.  Or maybe you could say that an ischemic stroke is worse than a hospitalization and then it comes out even or behind.  Of course we know that the cellular immunity generated generally lasts for decades while vaccine  side effects are very short-term, and that real world data can have huge confounding factors regardless.

The 0.02% was not found statistically significant in a reanalysis, and no other set of data showed up the same 0.02%.  However it cannot be ignored and needs to still be watched.",7,j4d8v23,t1_j4d527e,2023-01-15 06:10:36
mces97,10bty8k,"Oh, of course the risk of death is higher than .1%.

justgetoffmylawn,10bty8k,"Yep, not disagreeing - just wanted to point out that no matter how small a percentage you pick, it has to be balanced out by the bivalent efficacy.

I just mentioned it because I see people sometimes mention the risk of X outcome versus 100% protection.

So for something like myocarditis (which gets lots of press), the risk of getting it from infection is far higher than getting it from the vaccine. But that's not the relevant question - the question is to what degree does the vaccine protect you from still getting it from a subsequent infection.

> The early rollout was made possible by the ministry's operations teams completing preparations ahead of the deadline.

> In addition, there are ""benefits to administering early as infections are rising due to the XBB Omicron sub-variant"", said MOH.

> “The bivalent Moderna/Spikevax vaccine is based on the same original vaccine, with the same dosage for boosting,” added MOH.

> “Instead of targeting only the original COVID-19 virus, the updated version also targets the Omicron variant. It therefore will provide better protection against newer COVID-19 variants. It is proven to be safe and effective.”

> The ministry added that the approach and process of updating a vaccine with new strains of a disease is an “established practice”. It added that based on post market surveillance, to date more than 11 million updated bivalent mRNA vaccine doses have been administered in the US without any safety concerns reported.

I suppose if you've never contracted omicron before then you might find it useful. Otherwise, maybe wait for next years iPhone instead of buying an old model.",-11,irwk1vv,t1_irwchhc,2022-10-12 00:02:55

GroundbreakingGur930,y8qdwm,"SINGAPORE: Singapore plans to invite people aged between 18 and 49 to take their COVID-19 bivalent vaccines later in the year as more supplies are secured, Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung said on Thursday (Oct 21).

Mr Ong added that the authorities hope to secure these supplies in a matter of weeks. He was responding to questions from MPs Joan Pereira (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) and Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) on the timeline of the vaccines, how they compared with Moderna and Pfizer boosters in terms of efficacy and when someone who has recovered from COVID-19 should take this vaccine.

The Government had announced earlier that those who have yet to achieve minimum protection - or are aged 50 and above who last received their vaccine dose more than five months ago - can walk into any of nine Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres to receive their bivalent vaccine dose from Oct 14. 

Bivalent vaccines provide better protection against newer COVID-19 variants compared to the original vaccines, said Mr Ong. 

They work by simulating an immune response against two different antigens. For example, Moderna’s bivalent vaccine has been updated to protect against the Omicron BA.1 variant, in addition to the original strain.

The initial COVID-19 vaccines used in Singapore have been monovalent, which means they only contain or encode the spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The Government rolled out the bivalent Moderna/Spikevax vaccine on Oct 14, with the bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty expected to be available by the end of the year. 

While Singapore is prioritising people aged 50 and above for the additional booster dose, it is planning to invite those aged between 18 and 49 later in the year. 

If an eligible person is infected, they should wait three months to take the bivalent vaccine, Mr Ong said. 

MP Leon Perera (WP-Aljunied) also asked if the Health Ministry would consider reopening vaccination centres at community clubs and centres in areas with more elderly residents. 

Mr Ong said: ""Vaccination Centres and our Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres - they are chosen based on their proximity to high population density areas, good accessibility, and availability of the venue to support vaccination operations over a sustained period of time.""

Currently, there are 11 Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres and Vaccination Centres, and a network of 221 participating Public Health Preparedness Clinics and 20 polyclinics, which provide sufficient convenience and access to vaccinations, said Mr Ong. 

A BOOSTER EVERY YEAR

In a supplementary question, Ms Pereira said that many elderly residents who have taken second boosters are not sure if they can take bivalent vaccines and when to do so. 

Noting that this was a common question, Mr Ong said: ""The answer is yes,  five months after their second booster, they are recommended to take the bivalent vaccine.

""As I explained earlier, we have moved to a new system where we stop counting the number of booster shots we are taking. We are living with the COVID-19 virus ... what we are recommending people now is that - two concepts - one, please attain your minimum protection which is three doses of mRNA.""

""Beyond that, take an additional latest vaccine five months after your last shot, ... and no longer than 12 months,"" he added. He said this essentially worked out to taking a booster every year. 

MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) then asked if people who have had multiple infections should still take their boosters.

Mr Ong said in reply that it was best to ""ignore infections"".

""Because now that we have hybrid immunity from our vaccinations as well as infection, there are many individuals now who hardly have any response or symptoms after they are infected, so I think it's best not to count infection. Take our boosters and take our jabs diligently,"" he said. ",0,it1ffih,t3_y8qdwm,2022-10-20 14:21:53

sneakpeek_bot,yd1hv4,"> # Singapore grants interim authorisation for Pfizer bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine

> SINGAPORE: The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) on Tuesday (Oct 25) granted interim authorisation for Pfizer's Comirnaty bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine in Singapore.

> This makes it the second such jab to be approved for use here after the Moderna/Spikevax vaccine, which obtained interim authorisation in September and was rolled out earlier in October.

> The Comirnaty Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4/5) COVID-19 jab by Pfizer is an updated version of the original Comirnaty vaccine.

> It comprises two components - 15 micrograms targeting the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and 15 micrograms targeting the Omnicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants, said HSA in a news release.

> 

> The Comirnaty bivalent vaccine is authorised for use as a booster shot for individuals aged 12 and above, who have received primary series COVID-19 vaccination.

> Health Minister Ong Ye Kung has said that bivalent vaccines provide better protection against newer COVID-19 variants compared to the original vaccines.

> 

> Last week, he announced that Singapore plans to invite people aged between 18 and 49 to take their COVID-19 bivalent vaccines later in the year, as more supplies are secured.

> Earlier in October, the Government said it expects Pfizer's Comirnaty bivalent vaccine to be available in Singapore by the end of the year.

> It also announced then that children aged between five and 11 will be able to receive the Comirnaty vaccine as a booster dose.

> BENEFITS EXPECTED TO OUTWEIGH RISKS: HSA

> Official vaccination recommendations on the use of this booster will be issued by the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination and the Ministry of Health (MOH) in due time, added HSA.

> In making its regulatory decision, HSA said it consulted experts from its Medicines Advisory Committee and Panel of Infectious Diseases Experts.

> The authorisation was based on evidence including from Pfizer’s non-clinical studies, clinical trials with different variant-updated vaccines and manufacturing and quality processes.

> With the clinical study by Pfizer for its Comirnaty Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4/5) Vaccine still under way, the assessment of its efficacy was based primarily on an earlier clinical study conducted in individuals aged above 55 - but with the Comirnaty Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.1) Vaccine instead.

> ""HSA considers such data as relevant taking into account that these Omicron subvariants are closely related,"" said the authority.

> The study showed that the bivalent vaccine elicited a stronger immune response against the targeted Omicron BA.1 variant, while preserving adequate response against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, said HSA.

> An ongoing clinical study with the bivalent (Original/Omicron BA. 4/5) vaccine also showed, in 80 participants aged 18 and above, consistent trends of higher immune responses against the Omnicron BA. 4/5 variant, and continued response against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain.

> Safety data from the clinical studies showed that the bivalent vaccine was generally well-tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with what is known for the original vaccine, said HSA.

> 

> “The adverse events were mostly mild-to-moderate, such as injection site pain and/or tenderness, fatigue, headache and muscle pain,"" it added.

> 

> “These reactions are generally associated with vaccinations and expected as part of the body’s natural response to build immunity against COVID-19. They usually resolve on their own within a few days.""

> HSA said that based on the available information, it has assessed that the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks.

> It said it will continue to actively monitor the safety of the vaccine and require Pfizer to submit data from the ongoing clinical study, to ensure that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks.

> 

> HSA added that it will take the necessary actions and provide updates to the public if significant safety concerns are identified.

sneakpeek_bot,xetlo0,"> # New bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine doses expected to be available in Singapore by end-Sep: Moderna

> SINGAPORE: Moderna’s new bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine is expected to be available in Singapore by end of this month.

> “We hope to have hundreds of thousands of doses available in Singapore before the end of the month,” the pharmaceutical firm’s senior vice president of commercial vaccines Patrick Bergstedt told CNA on Wednesday (Sep 14).

> His comments came after the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) announced that it granted interim authorisation for Moderna’s Spikevax Bivalent Original/Omicron jab, the first bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine in the country.

> Official vaccination recommendations using this booster will be issued by the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination and the Ministry of Health (MOH) in due time, HSA said.

> Moderna, which set up a subsidiary in Singapore to support the delivery of mRNA vaccines, is transferring all its manufacturing capacity over to the new updated vaccine, Mr Bergstedt added.

> “Over time, the original vaccine will no longer be available. It will be replaced by this new updated bivalent vaccine,” he said.

> He gave assurance that Moderna’s original COVID-19 vaccine continues to offer protection, but noted that the level of protection wanes.

> “Because it was not specifically designed against the Omicron variant, that level of protection is not going to be as durable, as broad, as what the new updated vaccine provides,” he said.

> The newly approved booster vaccine contains the original COVID-19 virus and the BA.1 Omicron variant, but Moderna is already in “very advanced” stages of the next vaccine, he said.

> The upcoming vaccine will contain Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5 – which led to a recent COVID-19 wave in the country – and the original virus, he said.

> “The timing and availability of that vaccine will depend very much on the regulatory authorisation in Singapore,” he said.

> Singapore will also be bringing in the bivalent vaccine by Pfizer-BioNTech, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said earlier this week.

> EVOLVING VACCINES

> Infectious diseases specialist at Farrer Park Hospital, Dr Loh Jiashen, said that there is a possibility that COVID-19 vaccines may evolve to target more than one variant.

> “If variants of great impact emerge, I think vaccine companies may potentially go in that direction and subsequent vaccines may be even more than two-valent,” he said.
