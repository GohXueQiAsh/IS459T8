SINGAPORE: Data in Singapore on the bivalent COVID-19 vaccines does not show an increased risk of ischaemic stroke linked to either of the updated Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech shots, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday (Jan 14).  The Health Ministry's statement comes after US federal health authoritieswho received the bivalent vaccine.  \"In Singapore, the local data accrued for the bivalent vaccines at this time does not show an increased risk of ischaemic stroke after receiving either the Moderna or the Pfizer-BioNTech\/Comirnaty bivalent vaccine,\" said MOH.  \"The safety profile of the bivalent mRNA vaccines has been observed to be similar to that of their monovalent versions.\"  An ischaemic stroke, also known as brain ischaemia, is caused by blockages in arteries that carry blood to the brain.  The preliminary safety concern about the Pfizer bivalent shot was detected by one of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's monitoring systems known as the vaccine safety datalink (VSD).  It uncovered a possible safety issue in which people aged 65 and older were more likely to have an ischaemic stroke 21 days after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent shot, compared with days 22 to 44.  However, the US CDC said in a statement on Friday that it is \"very unlikely\" that Pfizer's bivalent COVID-19 shot carries an increased risk of stroke for people aged 65 and older.  No other surveillance system has detected a similar safety concern so far, said the health agency.  \"A large study of updated (bivalent) vaccines (from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services database revealed no increased risk of ischemic stroke,\" said the US CDC.  It also noted that other countries have not observed an increased risk for ischemic stroke with the updated bivalent vaccines, adding that the matter requires more investigation.  On Saturday, Singapore's Health Ministry said multiple international studies have shown that receiving an updated bivalent COVID-19 vaccine reduces the risk of severe disease and death by multiple folds compared to not receiving it.  \"It is important to remain up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccination to reduce one\u2019s risk of severe COVID-19, and to protect against current and future variants,\" said MOH.  \"The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) assess that the benefit of both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech\/Comirnaty COVID-19 bivalent vaccines continue to outweigh the risks.\"  The committee continues to recommend that people get their bivalent booster doses, the ministry added, noting that the US has also not changed its prevailing recommendations for individuals to receive the shots.  The preliminary safety concern was picked up in one vaccine safety monitoring system, but not observed and validated in other US safety systems or analyses, nor by other countries, MOH noted.  \"Pfizer and BioNTech have also stated in a statement that compared to published incidence rates of ischaemic stroke in this older population, they have to date observed a lower number of reported ischaemic strokes following vaccination with the bivalent vaccine,\" it added.","score":"58,861","date":"Jan 14, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"iceblendedchoc","body":"Must be drink NEWater that why neutralise all these !","score":"3,373","date":"Jan 14, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"Neon92","body":"Must also add those useless expert support claims too","score":"11,175","date":"Jan 14, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"Ev0d3vil","body":"I don't trust.

But a deep dive into several large databases failed to confirm the preliminary information, leading federal health officials to conclude the risk is extremely low \u2014 and probably nonexistent, those officials said Friday.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose system detected the early signal, and the Food and Drug Administration, which also assesses vaccine safety, have decided there is no need to change the recommendation that everyone 6 months and older should stay up to date with their coronavirus vaccinations, including those 5 and older who are eligible for the updated booster, according to officials speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the agencies.  The early signal involved the bivalent booster \u2014 which targets the original virus and omicron subvariants and became available starting in September \u2014 made by Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech. It did not apply to Moderna\u2019s updated booster, officials said.  Government vaccine safety experts have combed through databases containing millions of records in the United States and consulted with regulators in other countries but have not found any indication that the statistical signal represents a clinical risk to patients. They said they would continue to analyze the data. \u201cWe have looked at the totality of the evidence, and there are no concerns at this time that this represents a true safety signal,\u201d an FDA official said.  The FDA official said the government\u2019s sensitive vaccine safety systems are like a radio with the volume turned up high. Sometimes, when listening, \u201clike with a radio, you are going to hear some static in the background,\u201d the official said, adding it does not mean someone is talking. Chances are \u201cthis is just static and not someone real talking.\u201d  The review is happening as the pandemic grinds on, with the number of daily deaths rising and an increasingly frustrated White House urging Americans to get the booster to bolster their protection. Uptake remains low: Only 16 percent of people 5 and older and only 39 percent of those 65 and older, the most vulnerable group, have received the booster, according to the CDC.  The CDC and FDA described the early signal in a statement updating their websites Friday afternoon. The signal set off a debate among officials about whether and how to release the information. CDC officials argued for releasing it, while some other officials, including at the FDA, were concerned that putting out unconfirmed data would fuel anti-vaccine sentiment and scare older Americans into avoiding the boosters. Ultimately, the agencies decided to release the information in the hopes that transparency \u201cwill build confidence,\u201d said a CDC official.  The signal was detected in the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration involving the CDC and about a dozen health-care organizations with electronic health records on 12 million people. As part of routine monitoring for possible adverse events, officials noticed late last year that they were picking up indications of higher-than-expected stroke risk, officials said.  Among about 550,000 people 65 and older who had already been vaccinated and received a booster dose of the Pfizer bivalent vaccine, 130 people had strokes in the first three weeks after getting the shot. No deaths have been reported. That finding raised a question because it suggested that people who received the bivalent were more likely to have an ischemic stroke in the 21 days following vaccination compared with Days 22 through 42 following vaccination.  The findings prompted officials to look for similar findings. CDC officials conducted a different analysis in the Vaccine Safety Datalink system, using the same data but different methodology, and were not able to replicate the finding. Officials also searched other systems, including those of Medicare, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Pfizer\u2019s global surveillance network. Regulators in other countries, including Israel, also were consulted, but no evidence of similar findings emerged, the officials said.  The statement from the two agencies said that the government uses multiple systems to detect potential safety problems and that \u201coften these safety systems detect signals that could be due to factors other than the vaccine itself.\u201d  \u201cAlthough the totality of the data currently suggests that it is very unlikely that the signal \u2026 represents a true clinical risk,\u201d the statement said, \u201cwe believe it is important to share this information with the public.\u201d Kit Longley, a spokesman for Pfizer, said the company and its partner, BioNTech, have been made aware of the \u201climited reports\u201d of stroke. \u201cThere is no evidence to conclude that ischemic stroke is associated with the use of the companies\u2019 covid-19 vaccines,\u201d Longley said. He added that about 550 million doses of the companies\u2019 omicron-targeted bivalent shot have been delivered globally and about 30 million in the United States.  Safety experts say that safety signals occur frequently; if they don\u2019t, the system might not be sensitive enough. But there is a difference between signals and genuine safety risks. One of the reasons officials believe strongly there is not a safety risk is that they have not been able to come up with a plausible reason that such a problem would occur now \u2014 given the huge number of vaccines that have been administered worldwide since the end of 2020 \u2014 or why a problem would affect the Pfizer-BioNTech booster and not Moderna\u2019s. Both shots use mRNA technology.  Public health experts say it\u2019s important for the health agencies to be as transparent as possible about potential adverse events. If the information is not presented, public health agencies could be accused of hiding data. But such reports can be misinterpreted as causal when they are not.  The agencies said they will continue to evaluate data from the systems and will discuss the data and additional analyses at the FDA\u2019s previously scheduled Jan. 26 meeting with its vaccine advisers.  The Vaccine Safety Datalink has electronic health data that includes the kind of vaccine given to patients, the dates of vaccination and other vaccinations administered on the same day. It uses information on illnesses diagnosed at doctors\u2019 offices, in emergency rooms and in hospitals.  The system set up to monitor coronavirus vaccine safety is the most extensive in U.S. history.  In 2021, the system detected a link between the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and a rare but potentially deadly blood clotting and bleeding syndrome called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or TTS. The data prompted the FDA to impose new restrictions in May, saying only people who were unable or refusing to get other vaccines should receive the Johnson & Johnson shot.  There have also been concerns about the mRNA vaccines and the possible risk of a rare condition known as myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, in adolescent and young men. But federal health officials have said data shows that the known risks of covid-19 illness and its related, possibly severe complications far outweigh the potential risks.  In previous investigations of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and links to blood clots, and possible risks of myocarditis, officials found stronger signals as they searched additional safety databases. But that was not the case in this instance.  \u201cHere, as we continue to dig \u2026 it\u2019s disappearing rather than becoming stronger,\u201d the FDA official said.  TL;DR - The Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaborative project between CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office, integrated health care organizations, and networks across the U.S, picked up a possible sign that the Bivalent vaccine increases the risk of stroke in people 65 and older.  After searching through several large databases, including those from other countries like Israel, there was no evidence of similar findings. So the CDC's conclusion is the risk is extremely low to non-existent. They will continue to monitor.","score":"296","date":"Jan 15, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"tmkedmw","body":"US started Pfizer bivalent in Sep. Singapore started Pfizer bivalent on 12 Dec.

The potential risk with Pfizer\u2019s vaccine was not seen in other safety databases, nor was it seen with\u2019s Covid vaccine, the officials said in aon the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s website. The early finding still needs more investigation, and recommendations for the vaccine have not been changed, the statement said. \u201cWhen we find a signal we look for it in other parts of the system, which is what we\u2019ve done (and will continue to do),\u201d Kristen Nordlund, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an email.   The agencies said the possible link to stroke was seen in the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink. Investigation of the signal raised a question of whether people 65 and older who received the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent shot were more likely to have an ischemic stroke, a loss of blood flow in the brain, in the 21 days following vaccination compared with days 22-44 following vaccination, the agencies said in the statement.   \u201cThe totality of the data currently suggests that it is very unlikely that the signal in VSD represents a true clinical risk,\u201d the statement said.   Pfizer\u2019s bivalent booster is armed specifically to protect against two omicron variants, called BA4 and BA5. Messenger RNA Covid shots have been linked to pericarditis and myocarditis, inflammation of the heart and its surrounding tissue that\u2019s usually mild.  Pfizer and its partner\u201chave been made aware of limited reports of ischemic stroke\u201d in the CDC Vaccine Safety DataLink database in people 65 and older following vaccination after the companies\u2019 bivalent shot, a spokesperson said. There is no data to conclude that Pfizer\u2019s vaccine is causally associated with stroke, the spokesperson said.  Among 550,000 people 65 and older who had been vaccinated and received the Pfizer bivalent booster, 130 had strokes in the first three weeks after getting the shot, according to the CDC, and no deaths have been reported.

HSA considers such data as relevant taking into account that these Omicron subvariants are closely related. The study showed that the bivalent vaccine elicited a stronger immune response against the targeted Omicron BA.1 subvariant, while still maintaining an adequate response against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. This indicates that bivalent vaccines provide a broader immunity and better protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  6        The observed immune responses were further supported by the on-going Phase 2\/3 clinical study with the bivalent (Original\/Omicron BA.4\/5) vaccine, where a preliminary analysis in a subset of 80 participants aged 18 years and above showed consistent trends of higher immune responses against the Omicron BA.4\/5 subvariant and continued response against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain.

The authority received 59 and 11 adverse event reports for theandrespectively.  More than 482,600 doses of the Moderna bivalent vaccine have been administered since it was rolled out in Singapore on Oct 14 last year, while more than 202,300 Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent jabs have been given since Dec 12, 2022.  This means the HSA saw an adverse event reporting rate of 0.012 per cent for the Moderna bivalent vaccine and a smaller 0.005 per cent for the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine.  The adverse events reported for the bivalent mRNA vaccines were similar to those that took the monovalent vaccine. The non-serious adverse events include allergic reactions such as a rash, eyelid swelling, fever, giddiness, chest discomfort or an increase in blood pressure.  There were also six serious adverse events reported for the Moderna bivalent vaccine and two such events for the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine.  These include serious allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, myocarditis, hypotension with tachycardia \u2013 fast heartbeat \u2013 and hearing loss, said HSA.  An adverse event is classified as serious when it resulted in hospitalisation, a significant reduction in functioning level, a life-threatening illness or death.  The serious adverse events reporting rates for the two bivalent vaccines are similar, at 0.001 per cent.  HSA's latest update covers the period from the roll-out of the vaccines on Dec 30, 2020, to Dec 31, 2022. This is the first HSA safety update to include data on the bivalent shots.  Including the monovalent mRNA vaccines, more than 10.5 million primary doses, 4.6 million first booster doses and 1.2 million second booster shots have been administered in Singapore as of Dec 31, 2022.  The reporting rates of adverse and serious adverse events for the mRNA vaccines remained rare, at 0.11 per cent (17,741 reports) and 0.007 per cent (1,119 reports) respectively.  There were 173 serious adverse event reports (0.004 per cent) for the first booster jab and 17 such reports (0.001 per cent) for the second booster shot.  The Moderna vaccine waslast year as a primary vaccine for children aged six months to four years, while the Pfizer-BioNTech jab was also made available as a booster for children aged five years to 11 years.  As of Dec 31, 2022, more than 16,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine have been administered to children aged six months to four years, and more than 81,000 Pfizer-BioNTech booster jabs have been given to children aged five years to 11 years.  Serious adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination in children aged six months to 11 years are rare, said HSA.  There were eight adverse event reports after children aged six months to four years who took the Moderna jab, including five serious events that included fever, vomiting, fits, and Kawasaki disease \u2013 the swelling of blood vessels.  \"Febrile seizures and Kawasaki disease are rare events that have been reported following childhood vaccination and can be associated with childhood illnesses. All the children have recovered or were recovering at the time of report,\" said HSA.  There were 26 adverse event reports from the Pfizer-BioNTech booster jab for children aged five years to 11 years \u2013 a reporting rate of 0.03 per cent. This was lower than the adverse event reporting rate for the primary vaccination series in this age group, which stood at 0.15 per cent.  There were also two serious adverse events, with one describing myocarditis \u2013 the inflammation of heart muscles \u2013 and the other was a drop in platelet count.  Both children were recovering at the time of the report, said HSA.","score":"296","date":"Feb 2, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"potatohead","body":"2 minute read January 14, 20237:15 AM GMT+8Last Updated 6 hours ago   Vials with a sticker reading, \"COVID-19 \/ Coronavirus vaccine \/ Injection only\" and a medical syringe are seen in front of a displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken October 31, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  Jan 13 (Reuters) - A safety monitoring system flagged that U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Incand German partner BioNTech's updated COVID-19 shot could be linked to a type of brain stroke in older adults, according to preliminary data analyzed by U.S. health authorities.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)on Friday that a CDC vaccine database had uncovered a possible safety issue in which people 65 and older were more likely to have an ischemic stroke 21 days after receiving the Pfizer\/BioNTech bivalent shot, compared with days 22-44.  An ischemic stroke, also known as brain ischemia, is caused by blockages in arteries that carry blood to the brain.  The FDA and CDC said that other large studies, the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, other countries' databases and Pfizer-BioNTech's databases had not flagged this safety issue, adding that it requires more investigation.  \"Although the totality of the data currently suggests that it is very unlikely that the signal in VSD (Vaccine Safety Datalink) represents a true clinical risk, we believe it is important to share this information with the public,\" the health authorities said.  Pfizer and BioNTech said in a statement that they have been made aware of limited reports of ischemic strokes in people 65 and older following vaccination with their updated shot.  \"Neither Pfizer and BioNTech nor the CDC or FDA have observed similar findings across numerous other monitoring systems in the U.S. and globally and there is no evidence to conclude that ischemic stroke is associated with the use of the companies' COVID-19 vaccines,\" the companies added.  This safety concern has not been identified with Moderna'sbivalent shot and both the CDC and FDA continue to recommend that everyone aged 6 months and older stay up-to-date with their COVID-19 vaccination.","score":"378","date":"Jan 14, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"mrclubbie","body":"luckily i am skipping all further jabs","score":"58,861","date":"Jan 14, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"maikumgong","body":"Meh meh pak, ti ti pak!","score":"732","date":"Jan 14, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"ahsiahkiahz","body":"wuu marr sii gong gaa kana bohh arhneh kwan","score":"999","date":"Jan 14, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"peaceheart","body":"But oyk no comments leh","score":"15,727","date":"Jan 14, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"Clearnfc","body":"Bivalent and 3 jabs the same..... for some interesting reason, 0-2 jabs lower in serious cases....

SINGAPORE: With 386,000 bivalent COVID-19 vaccine doses issued since their introduction in mid-October, the Government hopes to encourage more sign-ups - especially among the elderly - with the rollout of mobile vaccination teams at several locations from Monday (Dec 12), said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung.  Theis being offered to people aged 12 and above from Monday. The other bivalent COVID-19 vaccine currently available in Singapore is from Moderna, which is for people aged 18 and above.  Both vaccines will be available at all mobile vaccination team locations.  Speaking at Hong Kah North Community Club (CC) \u2013 one of the locations for the mobile vaccination teams deployed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) \u2013 Mr Ong said that among the overall population, about five in 10,000 infections end up in the intensive care unit or die.  In comparison, there are about 70 deaths per 10,000 infections among those who are aged 70 and above as well as not up to date with their vaccinations or lacking minimum protection.  \u201cIt\u2019s quite significantly higher. So in the end, this is still about protecting the seniors, making sure they get up-to-date vaccinations,\u201d Mr Ong told reporters.  About nine in 10 seniors aged 60 and above have achieved minimum protection against COVID-19, said MOH earlier this month, adding that six in 10 were up to date with their vaccination.  There are still close to 40,000 eligible seniors who have not yet achieved minimum protection.  The mobile vaccination teams will be deployed at the following locations and corresponding dates: The public can also visit gowhere.gov.sg for the deployment schedule of the mobile vaccination teams.  More than 10,000 bivalent doses are given out each day.  Mr Neo Joo Yong, 70, was in line at Hong Kah North CC by himself on Monday. He walked from his home nearby to get his fourth dose \u2014 the Moderna bivalent vaccine \u2014 around 10am.  He previously wanted to get the jab in Jurong, and was glad to find out there was a mobile vaccination team located nearer to him.  Mr Neo, whose first three jabs were also under Moderna, told CNA he got his last dose in January.  He still hasn\u2019t gotten COVID-19 and in his household, only his son has caught the virus, he said.  Asked how he was able to keep himself free from COVID-19 throughout the pandemic, Mr Neo laughed and said in Mandarin, \u201cI\u2019m often at home. I only go out to exercise in the morning, but even then, I don\u2019t wear a mask.\u201d  He added that he \u201crarely falls sick\u201d, and didn\u2019t experience any side effects from his previous three jabs, except for a sore spot on the arm that went away \"after awhile\u201d.  Also at Hong Kah North CC getting her fourth jab alone was 66-year-old Mdm Ling Geck Hiok.  The retiree was similarly pleased to find a mobile vaccination team near her home, as she would otherwise have to make plans to head to another location in Taman Jurong. The latter, she had heard, was \u201ca bit far\u201d and \u201ca bit crowded\u201d.  Mdm Ling and her husband came down with COVID-19 for the first time last month, after their grandchild picked up the virus in school, but she noted that the experience was just \u201ca bit uncomfortable\u201d.  \u201cMaybe my body is a bit healthier. I rarely fall sick. Even the injections are only a little sore; by tomorrow the soreness will be gone,\u201d she told CNA in Mandarin.  Having already gone through three COVID-19 waves this year, Singapore\u2019s \u201cresilience is high\u201d, said Mr Ong.  But he noted that China\u2019s reopening meant there was \u201ca bit of uncertainty\u201d.  \u201cThis (is) bound to drive up infections, which we\u2019re not so worried (about), because our resilience is high and we've gone through already three waves this year. But the question is, with 1.3 billion people mostly uninfected and the disease starts to spread, we are bound to get mutations,\u201d Mr Ong said.  \u201cWhat we worry more (about) is what kind of mutations may come out of China. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re watching.\u201d  Nonetheless, Singapore\u2019s situation at the moment is \u201ccalm and stable\u201d, the health minister reiterated.  \u201cCases are on the low side. Obviously, now coming out the XBB (variant) wave, hospitals are still busy, A&E (accident and emergency departments) especially, but the volume of patients is also lower now. So there's a sigh of relief. Everything in general is calm.\"  It is during this \"lull period when things are calm\u201d that senior citizens should get their updated vaccinations, Mr Ong advised.","score":"58,861","date":"Dec 12, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"mrclubbie","body":"If you\u2019re aged 50 and above, you may walk into any Joint Testing and Vaccination Centre (JTVC), including mobile vaccination team locations, to receive your bivalent vaccine dose.

This is 200,000 more from the previous update by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Dec 12.  In response to queries from The Straits Times, MOH said over 133,000 individuals have received a shot of the bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech\/Comirnaty vaccine and over 453,000 have received the bivalent Moderna\/Spikevax vaccine.  Bivalent vaccines provide protection against the original Sars-CoV-2 strain of the virus, MOH said on Saturday that there are still about 39,000 eligible seniors who have not yet achieved minimum protection. This is down from the 40,000 figure provided in mid-December.  Minimum protection against Covid-19 requires individuals aged five and above to complete three mRNA or Novavax\/Nuvaxovid doses, or four Sinovac-CoronaVac doses.  To be up-to-date with your vaccination, eligible persons should receive an additional booster dose between five months and a year from the last vaccine dose.  As at Dec 30, 2022, 60 per cent of Singapore\u2019s eligible population has up-to-date vaccination, MOH said on its website.  MOH added that the bivalent vaccines have a similar safety profile as the original monovalent booster vaccines, based on international data such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s report on the 22.6 million bivalent booster doses administered in the United States.  and the bivalent version of Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s Comirnaty Covid-19 vaccine has been made available since Dec 12.  MOH said: \u201cThe bivalent vaccines will broaden protection against existing variants and potentially against future ones. This will ensure they have a high level of protection against severe Covid-19, which is important as we enter the festive period and interact with our friends and family.\u201d  Last Friday, MOH noted how China is facing a large infection wave that is of particular concern.  On a weekly basis, between 40 and 80 Covid-19 cases have been detected in travellers from China, mostly residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore.  This comes after China announced that from Jan 8, it will scrap quarantine measures for overseas arrivals after nearly three years of strict pandemic border restrictions.  MOH said last Friday it is ready to reinstate border health measures if warranted by the public health situation.  Infectious diseases experts noted that the coronavirus continues to spread globally, especially in China. They encouraged the public to take a booster if they are concerned, given how new sub-variants are bound to emerge, which will spread as effectively as those which drove previous Covid-19 waves.  Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, vice-dean of global health at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: \u201cInvestigators from MOH and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases recently showed that in individuals above the age of 80 years, having a second booster dose reduced the risk of hospitalisation and severe illness compared to those who had received only one booster dose, at least in the short term.\u201d  He added: \u201cIt may well be that updated Covid-19 vaccines should be administered annually or biannually to those at high risk of severe Covid-19 analogous to the flu vaccine, but the evidence to support such a strategy is still being gathered.\u201d  Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: \u201cIf you are young and healthy and recently had Covid-19, there is no urgency to get another shot, but if you are at greater risk, say because of age, you should consider getting another shot once you\u2019re eligible.\u201d","score":"58,861","date":"Jan 1, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"mrclubbie","body":"\u575a\u51b3\u4e0d\u6253","score":"58,861","date":"Jan 1, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"Ev0d3vil","body":"No VDS jab for what.

This Moderna vaccine protects against the original wildtype virus as well as the BA.1\/2 strains. And the XBB is an offshoot of the BA.2 strain.  Director of medical services Kenneth Mak said that protection against infection \"is a little bit stronger after the bivalent vaccine compared to the monovalent vaccine\".  Elaborating on this, he said the bivalent vaccine also expands the range of antibodies against all variants, giving better protection.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) had said earlier that the bivalent vaccine gives an antibody response against Omicron that is 75 per cent better than the original mRNA vaccine.","score":"7,467","date":"Oct 15, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"boyinhersense","body":"WHO\u2019s SAGE (Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization) has this to say:  \u201cfor bivalent variant-containing vaccine boosters over ancestral-virus-only boosters.\u201d","score":"1,567","date":"Oct 15, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"kuti-kuti","body":"Promo thread!","score":"9,801","date":"Oct 15, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"kuti-kuti","body":"Oong yee kia better come clean and pofma WHO","score":"9,801","date":"Oct 15, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"desmond_yee1","body":"that was the same tone when vaccination was first roll out last year, then suddenly studies find it wane in weeks","score":"25,199","date":"Oct 15, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"peaceheart","body":"Bivalent is for delta and omicorn right?

But a deep dive into several large databases failed to confirm the preliminary information, leading federal health officials to conclude the risk is extremely low \u2014 and probably nonexistent, those officials said Friday.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose system detected the early signal, and the Food and Drug Administration, which also assesses vaccine safety, have decided there is no need to change the recommendation that everyone 6 months and older should stay up to date with their coronavirus vaccinations, including those 5 and older who are eligible for the updated booster, according to officials speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the agencies.  The early signal involved the bivalent booster \u2014 which targets the original virus and omicron subvariants and became available starting in September \u2014 made by Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech. It did not apply to Moderna\u2019s updated booster, officials said.  Government vaccine safety experts have combed through databases containing millions of records in the United States and consulted with regulators in other countries but have not found any indication that the statistical signal represents a clinical risk to patients. They said they would continue to analyze the data. \u201cWe have looked at the totality of the evidence, and there are no concerns at this time that this represents a true safety signal,\u201d an FDA official said.  The FDA official said the government\u2019s sensitive vaccine safety systems are like a radio with the volume turned up high. Sometimes, when listening, \u201clike with a radio, you are going to hear some static in the background,\u201d the official said, adding it does not mean someone is talking. Chances are \u201cthis is just static and not someone real talking.\u201d  The review is happening as the pandemic grinds on, with the number of daily deaths rising and an increasingly frustrated White House urging Americans to get the booster to bolster their protection. Uptake remains low: Only 16 percent of people 5 and older and only 39 percent of those 65 and older, the most vulnerable group, have received the booster, according to the CDC.  The CDC and FDA described the early signal in a statement updating their websites Friday afternoon. The signal set off a debate among officials about whether and how to release the information. CDC officials argued for releasing it, while some other officials, including at the FDA, were concerned that putting out unconfirmed data would fuel anti-vaccine sentiment and scare older Americans into avoiding the boosters. Ultimately, the agencies decided to release the information in the hopes that transparency \u201cwill build confidence,\u201d said a CDC official.  The signal was detected in the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration involving the CDC and about a dozen health-care organizations with electronic health records on 12 million people. As part of routine monitoring for possible adverse events, officials noticed late last year that they were picking up indications of higher-than-expected stroke risk, officials said.  Among about 550,000 people 65 and older who had already been vaccinated and received a booster dose of the Pfizer bivalent vaccine, 130 people had strokes in the first three weeks after getting the shot. No deaths have been reported. That finding raised a question because it suggested that people who received the bivalent were more likely to have an ischemic stroke in the 21 days following vaccination compared with Days 22 through 42 following vaccination.  The findings prompted officials to look for similar findings. CDC officials conducted a different analysis in the Vaccine Safety Datalink system, using the same data but different methodology, and were not able to replicate the finding. Officials also searched other systems, including those of Medicare, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Pfizer\u2019s global surveillance network. Regulators in other countries, including Israel, also were consulted, but no evidence of similar findings emerged, the officials said.  The statement from the two agencies said that the government uses multiple systems to detect potential safety problems and that \u201coften these safety systems detect signals that could be due to factors other than the vaccine itself.\u201d  \u201cAlthough the totality of the data currently suggests that it is very unlikely that the signal \u2026 represents a true clinical risk,\u201d the statement said, \u201cwe believe it is important to share this information with the public.\u201d Kit Longley, a spokesman for Pfizer, said the company and its partner, BioNTech, have been made aware of the \u201climited reports\u201d of stroke. \u201cThere is no evidence to conclude that ischemic stroke is associated with the use of the companies\u2019 covid-19 vaccines,\u201d Longley said. He added that about 550 million doses of the companies\u2019 omicron-targeted bivalent shot have been delivered globally and about 30 million in the United States.  Safety experts say that safety signals occur frequently; if they don\u2019t, the system might not be sensitive enough. But there is a difference between signals and genuine safety risks. One of the reasons officials believe strongly there is not a safety risk is that they have not been able to come up with a plausible reason that such a problem would occur now \u2014 given the huge number of vaccines that have been administered worldwide since the end of 2020 \u2014 or why a problem would affect the Pfizer-BioNTech booster and not Moderna\u2019s. Both shots use mRNA technology.  Public health experts say it\u2019s important for the health agencies to be as transparent as possible about potential adverse events. If the information is not presented, public health agencies could be accused of hiding data. But such reports can be misinterpreted as causal when they are not.  The agencies said they will continue to evaluate data from the systems and will discuss the data and additional analyses at the FDA\u2019s previously scheduled Jan. 26 meeting with its vaccine advisers.  The Vaccine Safety Datalink has electronic health data that includes the kind of vaccine given to patients, the dates of vaccination and other vaccinations administered on the same day. It uses information on illnesses diagnosed at doctors\u2019 offices, in emergency rooms and in hospitals.  The system set up to monitor coronavirus vaccine safety is the most extensive in U.S. history.  In 2021, the system detected a link between the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and a rare but potentially deadly blood clotting and bleeding syndrome called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or TTS. The data prompted the FDA to impose new restrictions in May, saying only people who were unable or refusing to get other vaccines should receive the Johnson & Johnson shot.  There have also been concerns about the mRNA vaccines and the possible risk of a rare condition known as myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, in adolescent and young men. But federal health officials have said data shows that the known risks of covid-19 illness and its related, possibly severe complications far outweigh the potential risks.  In previous investigations of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and links to blood clots, and possible risks of myocarditis, officials found stronger signals as they searched additional safety databases. But that was not the case in this instance.  \u201cHere, as we continue to dig \u2026 it\u2019s disappearing rather than becoming stronger,\u201d the FDA official said.  TL;DR - The Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaborative project between CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office, integrated health care organizations, and networks across the U.S, picked up a possible sign that the Bivalent vaccine increases the risk of stroke in people 65 and older.  After searching through several large databases, including those from other countries like Israel, there was no evidence of similar findings. So the CDC's conclusion is the risk is extremely low to non-existent. They will continue to monitor.","score":"296","date":"Jan 15, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"tmkedmw","body":"US started Pfizer bivalent in Sep. Singapore started Pfizer bivalent on 12 Dec.

But a deep dive into several large databases failed to confirm the preliminary information, leading federal health officials to conclude the risk is extremely low \u2014 and probably nonexistent, those officials said Friday.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose system detected the early signal, and the Food and Drug Administration, which also assesses vaccine safety, have decided there is no need to change the recommendation that everyone 6 months and older should stay up to date with their coronavirus vaccinations, including those 5 and older who are eligible for the updated booster, according to officials speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the agencies.  The early signal involved the bivalent booster \u2014 which targets the original virus and omicron subvariants and became available starting in September \u2014 made by Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech. It did not apply to Moderna\u2019s updated booster, officials said.  Government vaccine safety experts have combed through databases containing millions of records in the United States and consulted with regulators in other countries but have not found any indication that the statistical signal represents a clinical risk to patients. They said they would continue to analyze the data. \u201cWe have looked at the totality of the evidence, and there are no concerns at this time that this represents a true safety signal,\u201d an FDA official said.  The FDA official said the government\u2019s sensitive vaccine safety systems are like a radio with the volume turned up high. Sometimes, when listening, \u201clike with a radio, you are going to hear some static in the background,\u201d the official said, adding it does not mean someone is talking. Chances are \u201cthis is just static and not someone real talking.\u201d  The review is happening as the pandemic grinds on, with the number of daily deaths rising and an increasingly frustrated White House urging Americans to get the booster to bolster their protection. Uptake remains low: Only 16 percent of people 5 and older and only 39 percent of those 65 and older, the most vulnerable group, have received the booster, according to the CDC.  The CDC and FDA described the early signal in a statement updating their websites Friday afternoon. The signal set off a debate among officials about whether and how to release the information. CDC officials argued for releasing it, while some other officials, including at the FDA, were concerned that putting out unconfirmed data would fuel anti-vaccine sentiment and scare older Americans into avoiding the boosters. Ultimately, the agencies decided to release the information in the hopes that transparency \u201cwill build confidence,\u201d said a CDC official.  The signal was detected in the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration involving the CDC and about a dozen health-care organizations with electronic health records on 12 million people. As part of routine monitoring for possible adverse events, officials noticed late last year that they were picking up indications of higher-than-expected stroke risk, officials said.  Among about 550,000 people 65 and older who had already been vaccinated and received a booster dose of the Pfizer bivalent vaccine, 130 people had strokes in the first three weeks after getting the shot. No deaths have been reported. That finding raised a question because it suggested that people who received the bivalent were more likely to have an ischemic stroke in the 21 days following vaccination compared with Days 22 through 42 following vaccination.  The findings prompted officials to look for similar findings. CDC officials conducted a different analysis in the Vaccine Safety Datalink system, using the same data but different methodology, and were not able to replicate the finding. Officials also searched other systems, including those of Medicare, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Pfizer\u2019s global surveillance network. Regulators in other countries, including Israel, also were consulted, but no evidence of similar findings emerged, the officials said.  The statement from the two agencies said that the government uses multiple systems to detect potential safety problems and that \u201coften these safety systems detect signals that could be due to factors other than the vaccine itself.\u201d  \u201cAlthough the totality of the data currently suggests that it is very unlikely that the signal \u2026 represents a true clinical risk,\u201d the statement said, \u201cwe believe it is important to share this information with the public.\u201d Kit Longley, a spokesman for Pfizer, said the company and its partner, BioNTech, have been made aware of the \u201climited reports\u201d of stroke. \u201cThere is no evidence to conclude that ischemic stroke is associated with the use of the companies\u2019 covid-19 vaccines,\u201d Longley said. He added that about 550 million doses of the companies\u2019 omicron-targeted bivalent shot have been delivered globally and about 30 million in the United States.  Safety experts say that safety signals occur frequently; if they don\u2019t, the system might not be sensitive enough. But there is a difference between signals and genuine safety risks. One of the reasons officials believe strongly there is not a safety risk is that they have not been able to come up with a plausible reason that such a problem would occur now \u2014 given the huge number of vaccines that have been administered worldwide since the end of 2020 \u2014 or why a problem would affect the Pfizer-BioNTech booster and not Moderna\u2019s. Both shots use mRNA technology.  Public health experts say it\u2019s important for the health agencies to be as transparent as possible about potential adverse events. If the information is not presented, public health agencies could be accused of hiding data. But such reports can be misinterpreted as causal when they are not.  The agencies said they will continue to evaluate data from the systems and will discuss the data and additional analyses at the FDA\u2019s previously scheduled Jan. 26 meeting with its vaccine advisers.  The Vaccine Safety Datalink has electronic health data that includes the kind of vaccine given to patients, the dates of vaccination and other vaccinations administered on the same day. It uses information on illnesses diagnosed at doctors\u2019 offices, in emergency rooms and in hospitals.  The system set up to monitor coronavirus vaccine safety is the most extensive in U.S. history.  In 2021, the system detected a link between the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and a rare but potentially deadly blood clotting and bleeding syndrome called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or TTS. The data prompted the FDA to impose new restrictions in May, saying only people who were unable or refusing to get other vaccines should receive the Johnson & Johnson shot.  There have also been concerns about the mRNA vaccines and the possible risk of a rare condition known as myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, in adolescent and young men. But federal health officials have said data shows that the known risks of covid-19 illness and its related, possibly severe complications far outweigh the potential risks.  In previous investigations of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and links to blood clots, and possible risks of myocarditis, officials found stronger signals as they searched additional safety databases. But that was not the case in this instance.  \u201cHere, as we continue to dig \u2026 it\u2019s disappearing rather than becoming stronger,\u201d the FDA official said.  TL;DR - The Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaborative project between CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office, integrated health care organizations, and networks across the U.S, picked up a possible sign that the Bivalent vaccine increases the risk of stroke in people 65 and older.  After searching through several large databases, including those from other countries like Israel, there was no evidence of similar findings. So the CDC's conclusion is the risk is extremely low to non-existent. They will continue to monitor.","score":"296","date":"Jan 15, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"tmkedmw","body":"US started Pfizer bivalent in Sep. Singapore started Pfizer bivalent on 12 Dec.

But a deep dive into several large databases failed to confirm the preliminary information, leading federal health officials to conclude the risk is extremely low \u2014 and probably nonexistent, those officials said Friday.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose system detected the early signal, and the Food and Drug Administration, which also assesses vaccine safety, have decided there is no need to change the recommendation that everyone 6 months and older should stay up to date with their coronavirus vaccinations, including those 5 and older who are eligible for the updated booster, according to officials speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the agencies.  The early signal involved the bivalent booster \u2014 which targets the original virus and omicron subvariants and became available starting in September \u2014 made by Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech. It did not apply to Moderna\u2019s updated booster, officials said.  Government vaccine safety experts have combed through databases containing millions of records in the United States and consulted with regulators in other countries but have not found any indication that the statistical signal represents a clinical risk to patients. They said they would continue to analyze the data. \u201cWe have looked at the totality of the evidence, and there are no concerns at this time that this represents a true safety signal,\u201d an FDA official said.  The FDA official said the government\u2019s sensitive vaccine safety systems are like a radio with the volume turned up high. Sometimes, when listening, \u201clike with a radio, you are going to hear some static in the background,\u201d the official said, adding it does not mean someone is talking. Chances are \u201cthis is just static and not someone real talking.\u201d  The review is happening as the pandemic grinds on, with the number of daily deaths rising and an increasingly frustrated White House urging Americans to get the booster to bolster their protection. Uptake remains low: Only 16 percent of people 5 and older and only 39 percent of those 65 and older, the most vulnerable group, have received the booster, according to the CDC.  The CDC and FDA described the early signal in a statement updating their websites Friday afternoon. The signal set off a debate among officials about whether and how to release the information. CDC officials argued for releasing it, while some other officials, including at the FDA, were concerned that putting out unconfirmed data would fuel anti-vaccine sentiment and scare older Americans into avoiding the boosters. Ultimately, the agencies decided to release the information in the hopes that transparency \u201cwill build confidence,\u201d said a CDC official.  The signal was detected in the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration involving the CDC and about a dozen health-care organizations with electronic health records on 12 million people. As part of routine monitoring for possible adverse events, officials noticed late last year that they were picking up indications of higher-than-expected stroke risk, officials said.  Among about 550,000 people 65 and older who had already been vaccinated and received a booster dose of the Pfizer bivalent vaccine, 130 people had strokes in the first three weeks after getting the shot. No deaths have been reported. That finding raised a question because it suggested that people who received the bivalent were more likely to have an ischemic stroke in the 21 days following vaccination compared with Days 22 through 42 following vaccination.  The findings prompted officials to look for similar findings. CDC officials conducted a different analysis in the Vaccine Safety Datalink system, using the same data but different methodology, and were not able to replicate the finding. Officials also searched other systems, including those of Medicare, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Pfizer\u2019s global surveillance network. Regulators in other countries, including Israel, also were consulted, but no evidence of similar findings emerged, the officials said.  The statement from the two agencies said that the government uses multiple systems to detect potential safety problems and that \u201coften these safety systems detect signals that could be due to factors other than the vaccine itself.\u201d  \u201cAlthough the totality of the data currently suggests that it is very unlikely that the signal \u2026 represents a true clinical risk,\u201d the statement said, \u201cwe believe it is important to share this information with the public.\u201d Kit Longley, a spokesman for Pfizer, said the company and its partner, BioNTech, have been made aware of the \u201climited reports\u201d of stroke. \u201cThere is no evidence to conclude that ischemic stroke is associated with the use of the companies\u2019 covid-19 vaccines,\u201d Longley said. He added that about 550 million doses of the companies\u2019 omicron-targeted bivalent shot have been delivered globally and about 30 million in the United States.  Safety experts say that safety signals occur frequently; if they don\u2019t, the system might not be sensitive enough. But there is a difference between signals and genuine safety risks. One of the reasons officials believe strongly there is not a safety risk is that they have not been able to come up with a plausible reason that such a problem would occur now \u2014 given the huge number of vaccines that have been administered worldwide since the end of 2020 \u2014 or why a problem would affect the Pfizer-BioNTech booster and not Moderna\u2019s. Both shots use mRNA technology.  Public health experts say it\u2019s important for the health agencies to be as transparent as possible about potential adverse events. If the information is not presented, public health agencies could be accused of hiding data. But such reports can be misinterpreted as causal when they are not.  The agencies said they will continue to evaluate data from the systems and will discuss the data and additional analyses at the FDA\u2019s previously scheduled Jan. 26 meeting with its vaccine advisers.  The Vaccine Safety Datalink has electronic health data that includes the kind of vaccine given to patients, the dates of vaccination and other vaccinations administered on the same day. It uses information on illnesses diagnosed at doctors\u2019 offices, in emergency rooms and in hospitals.  The system set up to monitor coronavirus vaccine safety is the most extensive in U.S. history.  In 2021, the system detected a link between the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and a rare but potentially deadly blood clotting and bleeding syndrome called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or TTS. The data prompted the FDA to impose new restrictions in May, saying only people who were unable or refusing to get other vaccines should receive the Johnson & Johnson shot.  There have also been concerns about the mRNA vaccines and the possible risk of a rare condition known as myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, in adolescent and young men. But federal health officials have said data shows that the known risks of covid-19 illness and its related, possibly severe complications far outweigh the potential risks.  In previous investigations of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and links to blood clots, and possible risks of myocarditis, officials found stronger signals as they searched additional safety databases. But that was not the case in this instance.  \u201cHere, as we continue to dig \u2026 it\u2019s disappearing rather than becoming stronger,\u201d the FDA official said.  TL;DR - The Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaborative project between CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office, integrated health care organizations, and networks across the U.S, picked up a possible sign that the Bivalent vaccine increases the risk of stroke in people 65 and older.  After searching through several large databases, including those from other countries like Israel, there was no evidence of similar findings. So the CDC's conclusion is the risk is extremely low to non-existent. They will continue to monitor.","score":"296","date":"Jan 15, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"tmkedmw","body":"US started Pfizer bivalent in Sep. Singapore started Pfizer bivalent on 12 Dec.

Some of his videos on YouTube were removed not because they were anti-vax but because his interpretation of the data was wrong and as a result he was spreading misinformation.  To give you a simple example of wrong interpretation of data :  100,000 people of different ages ranging from 1-100. Most of age 60 and above have had 3-5 vaccinations. Most of those age 20-60 have had 2-3 vaccinations. Most of those age 1-20 have had 0-2 vaccinations.  A study found that the risk of death from covid is highly positively correlated to the number of vaccinations.  So kum gong kias erroneously conclude that that more vaccinations cause more death.  Why is it wrong?  I will let the kum gong kias figure it out.  (Hint : about 95% of deaths are age above 60).  Likewise, there are many possible reasons why in the study in question here, the number of infections is higher for people with more vaccination.

But a deep dive into several large databases failed to confirm the preliminary information, leading federal health officials to conclude the risk is extremely low \u2014 and probably nonexistent, those officials said Friday.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose system detected the early signal, and the Food and Drug Administration, which also assesses vaccine safety, have decided there is no need to change the recommendation that everyone 6 months and older should stay up to date with their coronavirus vaccinations, including those 5 and older who are eligible for the updated booster, according to officials speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the agencies.  The early signal involved the bivalent booster \u2014 which targets the original virus and omicron subvariants and became available starting in September \u2014 made by Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech. It did not apply to Moderna\u2019s updated booster, officials said.  Government vaccine safety experts have combed through databases containing millions of records in the United States and consulted with regulators in other countries but have not found any indication that the statistical signal represents a clinical risk to patients. They said they would continue to analyze the data. \u201cWe have looked at the totality of the evidence, and there are no concerns at this time that this represents a true safety signal,\u201d an FDA official said.  The FDA official said the government\u2019s sensitive vaccine safety systems are like a radio with the volume turned up high. Sometimes, when listening, \u201clike with a radio, you are going to hear some static in the background,\u201d the official said, adding it does not mean someone is talking. Chances are \u201cthis is just static and not someone real talking.\u201d  The review is happening as the pandemic grinds on, with the number of daily deaths rising and an increasingly frustrated White House urging Americans to get the booster to bolster their protection. Uptake remains low: Only 16 percent of people 5 and older and only 39 percent of those 65 and older, the most vulnerable group, have received the booster, according to the CDC.  The CDC and FDA described the early signal in a statement updating their websites Friday afternoon. The signal set off a debate among officials about whether and how to release the information. CDC officials argued for releasing it, while some other officials, including at the FDA, were concerned that putting out unconfirmed data would fuel anti-vaccine sentiment and scare older Americans into avoiding the boosters. Ultimately, the agencies decided to release the information in the hopes that transparency \u201cwill build confidence,\u201d said a CDC official.  The signal was detected in the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration involving the CDC and about a dozen health-care organizations with electronic health records on 12 million people. As part of routine monitoring for possible adverse events, officials noticed late last year that they were picking up indications of higher-than-expected stroke risk, officials said.  Among about 550,000 people 65 and older who had already been vaccinated and received a booster dose of the Pfizer bivalent vaccine, 130 people had strokes in the first three weeks after getting the shot. No deaths have been reported. That finding raised a question because it suggested that people who received the bivalent were more likely to have an ischemic stroke in the 21 days following vaccination compared with Days 22 through 42 following vaccination.  The findings prompted officials to look for similar findings. CDC officials conducted a different analysis in the Vaccine Safety Datalink system, using the same data but different methodology, and were not able to replicate the finding. Officials also searched other systems, including those of Medicare, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Pfizer\u2019s global surveillance network. Regulators in other countries, including Israel, also were consulted, but no evidence of similar findings emerged, the officials said.  The statement from the two agencies said that the government uses multiple systems to detect potential safety problems and that \u201coften these safety systems detect signals that could be due to factors other than the vaccine itself.\u201d  \u201cAlthough the totality of the data currently suggests that it is very unlikely that the signal \u2026 represents a true clinical risk,\u201d the statement said, \u201cwe believe it is important to share this information with the public.\u201d Kit Longley, a spokesman for Pfizer, said the company and its partner, BioNTech, have been made aware of the \u201climited reports\u201d of stroke. \u201cThere is no evidence to conclude that ischemic stroke is associated with the use of the companies\u2019 covid-19 vaccines,\u201d Longley said. He added that about 550 million doses of the companies\u2019 omicron-targeted bivalent shot have been delivered globally and about 30 million in the United States.  Safety experts say that safety signals occur frequently; if they don\u2019t, the system might not be sensitive enough. But there is a difference between signals and genuine safety risks. One of the reasons officials believe strongly there is not a safety risk is that they have not been able to come up with a plausible reason that such a problem would occur now \u2014 given the huge number of vaccines that have been administered worldwide since the end of 2020 \u2014 or why a problem would affect the Pfizer-BioNTech booster and not Moderna\u2019s. Both shots use mRNA technology.  Public health experts say it\u2019s important for the health agencies to be as transparent as possible about potential adverse events. If the information is not presented, public health agencies could be accused of hiding data. But such reports can be misinterpreted as causal when they are not.  The agencies said they will continue to evaluate data from the systems and will discuss the data and additional analyses at the FDA\u2019s previously scheduled Jan. 26 meeting with its vaccine advisers.  The Vaccine Safety Datalink has electronic health data that includes the kind of vaccine given to patients, the dates of vaccination and other vaccinations administered on the same day. It uses information on illnesses diagnosed at doctors\u2019 offices, in emergency rooms and in hospitals.  The system set up to monitor coronavirus vaccine safety is the most extensive in U.S. history.  In 2021, the system detected a link between the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and a rare but potentially deadly blood clotting and bleeding syndrome called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or TTS. The data prompted the FDA to impose new restrictions in May, saying only people who were unable or refusing to get other vaccines should receive the Johnson & Johnson shot.  There have also been concerns about the mRNA vaccines and the possible risk of a rare condition known as myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, in adolescent and young men. But federal health officials have said data shows that the known risks of covid-19 illness and its related, possibly severe complications far outweigh the potential risks.  In previous investigations of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and links to blood clots, and possible risks of myocarditis, officials found stronger signals as they searched additional safety databases. But that was not the case in this instance.  \u201cHere, as we continue to dig \u2026 it\u2019s disappearing rather than becoming stronger,\u201d the FDA official said.  TL;DR - The Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaborative project between CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office, integrated health care organizations, and networks across the U.S, picked up a possible sign that the Bivalent vaccine increases the risk of stroke in people 65 and older.  After searching through several large databases, including those from other countries like Israel, there was no evidence of similar findings. So the CDC's conclusion is the risk is extremely low to non-existent. They will continue to monitor.","score":"296","date":"Jan 15, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"tmkedmw","body":"US started Pfizer bivalent in Sep. Singapore started Pfizer bivalent on 12 Dec.

But a deep dive into several large databases failed to confirm the preliminary information, leading federal health officials to conclude the risk is extremely low \u2014 and probably nonexistent, those officials said Friday.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose system detected the early signal, and the Food and Drug Administration, which also assesses vaccine safety, have decided there is no need to change the recommendation that everyone 6 months and older should stay up to date with their coronavirus vaccinations, including those 5 and older who are eligible for the updated booster, according to officials speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the agencies.  The early signal involved the bivalent booster \u2014 which targets the original virus and omicron subvariants and became available starting in September \u2014 made by Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech. It did not apply to Moderna\u2019s updated booster, officials said.  Government vaccine safety experts have combed through databases containing millions of records in the United States and consulted with regulators in other countries but have not found any indication that the statistical signal represents a clinical risk to patients. They said they would continue to analyze the data. \u201cWe have looked at the totality of the evidence, and there are no concerns at this time that this represents a true safety signal,\u201d an FDA official said.  The FDA official said the government\u2019s sensitive vaccine safety systems are like a radio with the volume turned up high. Sometimes, when listening, \u201clike with a radio, you are going to hear some static in the background,\u201d the official said, adding it does not mean someone is talking. Chances are \u201cthis is just static and not someone real talking.\u201d  The review is happening as the pandemic grinds on, with the number of daily deaths rising and an increasingly frustrated White House urging Americans to get the booster to bolster their protection. Uptake remains low: Only 16 percent of people 5 and older and only 39 percent of those 65 and older, the most vulnerable group, have received the booster, according to the CDC.  The CDC and FDA described the early signal in a statement updating their websites Friday afternoon. The signal set off a debate among officials about whether and how to release the information. CDC officials argued for releasing it, while some other officials, including at the FDA, were concerned that putting out unconfirmed data would fuel anti-vaccine sentiment and scare older Americans into avoiding the boosters. Ultimately, the agencies decided to release the information in the hopes that transparency \u201cwill build confidence,\u201d said a CDC official.  The signal was detected in the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration involving the CDC and about a dozen health-care organizations with electronic health records on 12 million people. As part of routine monitoring for possible adverse events, officials noticed late last year that they were picking up indications of higher-than-expected stroke risk, officials said.  Among about 550,000 people 65 and older who had already been vaccinated and received a booster dose of the Pfizer bivalent vaccine, 130 people had strokes in the first three weeks after getting the shot. No deaths have been reported. That finding raised a question because it suggested that people who received the bivalent were more likely to have an ischemic stroke in the 21 days following vaccination compared with Days 22 through 42 following vaccination.  The findings prompted officials to look for similar findings. CDC officials conducted a different analysis in the Vaccine Safety Datalink system, using the same data but different methodology, and were not able to replicate the finding. Officials also searched other systems, including those of Medicare, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Pfizer\u2019s global surveillance network. Regulators in other countries, including Israel, also were consulted, but no evidence of similar findings emerged, the officials said.  The statement from the two agencies said that the government uses multiple systems to detect potential safety problems and that \u201coften these safety systems detect signals that could be due to factors other than the vaccine itself.\u201d  \u201cAlthough the totality of the data currently suggests that it is very unlikely that the signal \u2026 represents a true clinical risk,\u201d the statement said, \u201cwe believe it is important to share this information with the public.\u201d Kit Longley, a spokesman for Pfizer, said the company and its partner, BioNTech, have been made aware of the \u201climited reports\u201d of stroke. \u201cThere is no evidence to conclude that ischemic stroke is associated with the use of the companies\u2019 covid-19 vaccines,\u201d Longley said. He added that about 550 million doses of the companies\u2019 omicron-targeted bivalent shot have been delivered globally and about 30 million in the United States.  Safety experts say that safety signals occur frequently; if they don\u2019t, the system might not be sensitive enough. But there is a difference between signals and genuine safety risks. One of the reasons officials believe strongly there is not a safety risk is that they have not been able to come up with a plausible reason that such a problem would occur now \u2014 given the huge number of vaccines that have been administered worldwide since the end of 2020 \u2014 or why a problem would affect the Pfizer-BioNTech booster and not Moderna\u2019s. Both shots use mRNA technology.  Public health experts say it\u2019s important for the health agencies to be as transparent as possible about potential adverse events. If the information is not presented, public health agencies could be accused of hiding data. But such reports can be misinterpreted as causal when they are not.  The agencies said they will continue to evaluate data from the systems and will discuss the data and additional analyses at the FDA\u2019s previously scheduled Jan. 26 meeting with its vaccine advisers.  The Vaccine Safety Datalink has electronic health data that includes the kind of vaccine given to patients, the dates of vaccination and other vaccinations administered on the same day. It uses information on illnesses diagnosed at doctors\u2019 offices, in emergency rooms and in hospitals.  The system set up to monitor coronavirus vaccine safety is the most extensive in U.S. history.  In 2021, the system detected a link between the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and a rare but potentially deadly blood clotting and bleeding syndrome called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or TTS. The data prompted the FDA to impose new restrictions in May, saying only people who were unable or refusing to get other vaccines should receive the Johnson & Johnson shot.  There have also been concerns about the mRNA vaccines and the possible risk of a rare condition known as myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, in adolescent and young men. But federal health officials have said data shows that the known risks of covid-19 illness and its related, possibly severe complications far outweigh the potential risks.  In previous investigations of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and links to blood clots, and possible risks of myocarditis, officials found stronger signals as they searched additional safety databases. But that was not the case in this instance.  \u201cHere, as we continue to dig \u2026 it\u2019s disappearing rather than becoming stronger,\u201d the FDA official said.  TL;DR - The Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaborative project between CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office, integrated health care organizations, and networks across the U.S, picked up a possible sign that the Bivalent vaccine increases the risk of stroke in people 65 and older.  After searching through several large databases, including those from other countries like Israel, there was no evidence of similar findings. So the CDC's conclusion is the risk is extremely low to non-existent. They will continue to monitor.","score":"296","date":"Jan 15, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"tmkedmw","body":"US started Pfizer bivalent in Sep. Singapore started Pfizer bivalent on 12 Dec.

In the light of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC), bivalent COVID-19 vaccines combining the wild-type spike mRNA with an Omicron VOC BA.1 or BA.4-5 spike mRNA became available. This non-randomized controlled study examined adverse reactions, PRN () medication intake and inability to work after a fourth COVID-19 vaccination among 76 healthcare workers. As fourth dose either the original, monovalent BNT162b2mRNA (48.7%) or the bivalent BNT162b2mRNA original\/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine (51.3%) was administered. The rate of adverse reactions for the second booster dose was significantly higher among participants receiving the bivalent 84.6% (95% CI 70.3%-92.8%; 33\/39) compared to the monovalent 51.4% (95% CI 35.9-66.6%; 19\/37) vaccine (p=0.0028). Also, there was a trend towards an increased rate of inability to work and intake of PRN medication following bivalent vaccination. In view of preprints reporting inconclusive results in neutralizing antibody levels between the compared vaccines, our results and further studies on safety and reactogenicity of bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines are highly important to aid clinical decision making in the choice between bivalent and monovalent vaccinations. Vaccination is a key prevention method against COVID-19 but emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC), especially the Omicron VOC, have impaired the effectiveness of the original, wild-type SARS-CoV-2 based COVID-19 vaccines.[,] Consequently, bivalent COVID-19 vaccines combining the wild-type spike mRNA with an Omicron VOC BA.1 or BA.4-5 spike mRNA became available. For the bivalent mRNA-1273.214 vaccine (Wuhan-Hu-1\/BA.1) slightly higher rates of the predominant adverse reactions have been reported.[] However, due to approval without an additional clinical study to date no evidence is available on adverse reactions and inability to work following a BA.4-5 adapted, bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. This non-randomized controlled study examined adverse reactions, PRN () medication intake and inability to work after a fourth vaccination (i.e. second booster) among HCWs (healthcare workers) of the prospective CoVacSer study. All enrolled individuals previously had been administered an EMA-approved COVID-19 basic immunization, and a subsequent third, mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination, defined as first booster vaccination. The second booster was performed with the monovalent BNT162b2mRNA vaccine or the bivalent BNT162b2mRNA original\/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine. Study participants administered with a different COVID-19 vaccine as second booster were excluded. As coadministration of COVID-19 and influenza vaccination might influence immunogenicity and side effects,[] individuals receiving a simultaneous influenza vaccination were also excluded. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics committee of the University of Wuerzburg in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (file no. 79\/21). Data on adverse reactions, inability to work, PRN medication and sociodemographic factors were collected by a questionnaire using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture,). Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.4.1 (GraphPad Software, San Diego CA, USA). Null-hypothesis testing was performed using Fisher\u2019s exact test (for gender, smoking, SARS-CoV-2 convalescence, side effects, PRN drug intake and percentage inability to work) and Mann-Whitney U test (for BMI, age and interval between both booster vaccinations). The two-tailed significance level \u03b1 was set to 0.05. 76 HCWs received a fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccination between the 13th of August 2021 and the 14th of October 2022 with either the original, monovalent BNT162b2mRNA (48.7%, 37\/76) or the bivalent BNT162b2mRNA original\/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine (51.3%, 39\/76). Socio-demographic characteristics are presented in. Table 1: Comparative characteristics of HCWs with a monovalent or bivalent second COVID-19 booster vaccination.

The rate of adverse reactions for the second booster dose was significantly higher among participants receiving the bivalent 84.6% (95% CI 70.3%-92.8%; 33\/39) compared to the monovalent 51.4% (95% CI 35.9-66.6%; 19\/37) vaccine (p=0.0028). Bivalent vaccinated participants further reported higher rates of adverse reactions in all subcategories (). Also, there were more frequent intake of PRN medication () and numerically higher rates of work ability restrictions () in the bivalent vaccinated group.      Individuals receiving a second COVID-19 booster vaccination with the bivalent BNT162b2mRNA original\/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine reported adverse reactions more frequently compared to those receiving the monovalent vaccine. Also, there was a trend towards an increased rate of inability to work and intake of PRN medication following bivalent vaccination. Limitations of this study are the retrospective questionnaire-based assessment, the lack of randomization and blinding as well as the difference in the interval between both booster vaccinations between the two groups. Our study focused on a direct comparison between the monovalent BNT162b2mRNA and the corresponding bivalent vaccine. In the light of preprints reporting inconclusive results in neutralizing antibody levels between the compared vaccines,[-] our results and further studies on safety and reactogenicity of bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines are highly important to aid clinical decision making in the choice between bivalent and monovalent vaccinations. Additional data that underlie the results reported in this article, after de-identification (text, tables, figures, and appendices) as well as the study protocol, statistical analysis plan, and analytic code is made available to researchers who provide a methodologically sound proposal to achieve aims in the approved proposal on request to the corresponding author.","score":"28","date":"Nov 20, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"jonjon88","body":"Fake news\u2026 must pump for added protection i was told","score":"886","date":"Nov 20, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"edmwing","body":"Fake news, SG govt never make mistake.","score":"440","date":"Nov 20, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"KPO_SAHM","body":"158 never reported should be fake news.","score":"3,991","date":"Nov 20, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"GuiGuZi","body":"I'm sure they put in more than 8 months of due diligence in this case!","score":"739","date":"Nov 20, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"shoograd","body":"I got nothing against vax but don't want it to be a yearly thing.

A couple of the questions have been overtaken by events. We have started using the bivalent Moderna\/Spikevax vaccine on 14 October 2022, and the bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech\/Comirnaty is expected to be available by the end of this year. Bivalent vaccines provide better protection against newer COVID-19 variants compared to the original vaccines, and we recommend individuals who are eligible to take it.  We are prioritising persons aged 50 and above for the additional booster dose with the bivalent vaccine as they are at higher risk of severe disease from infection. We are planning to invite those aged between 18 and 49 for vaccination later in the year as we secure more supplies and I hope we will secure them in a matter of weeks.","score":"4,768","date":"Nov 7, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"evilduxy","body":"thought bbfa all anti vaxx de y suddenly must take extra shot","score":"585","date":"Nov 7, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"tankgunner","body":"3 months is the guideline","score":"47,534","date":"Nov 7, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"North Tree","body":"Thanks very much","score":"195","date":"Nov 7, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"ballastic90","body":"Aorund 3 months like that","score":"4,139","date":"Nov 7, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"Yapsc02","body":"Vaccine save us, if without vaccine, you and me already dead,hope we can jab more booster every year or every few months, thanks oyk, we will vote for you for 1000000 years.","score":"656","date":"Dec 13, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"peaceheart","body":"This oyk is more irritating than insurance and property agents.

But a deep dive into several large databases failed to confirm the preliminary information, leading federal health officials to conclude the risk is extremely low \u2014 and probably nonexistent, those officials said Friday.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose system detected the early signal, and the Food and Drug Administration, which also assesses vaccine safety, have decided there is no need to change the recommendation that everyone 6 months and older should stay up to date with their coronavirus vaccinations, including those 5 and older who are eligible for the updated booster, according to officials speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the agencies.  The early signal involved the bivalent booster \u2014 which targets the original virus and omicron subvariants and became available starting in September \u2014 made by Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech. It did not apply to Moderna\u2019s updated booster, officials said.  Government vaccine safety experts have combed through databases containing millions of records in the United States and consulted with regulators in other countries but have not found any indication that the statistical signal represents a clinical risk to patients. They said they would continue to analyze the data. \u201cWe have looked at the totality of the evidence, and there are no concerns at this time that this represents a true safety signal,\u201d an FDA official said.  The FDA official said the government\u2019s sensitive vaccine safety systems are like a radio with the volume turned up high. Sometimes, when listening, \u201clike with a radio, you are going to hear some static in the background,\u201d the official said, adding it does not mean someone is talking. Chances are \u201cthis is just static and not someone real talking.\u201d  The review is happening as the pandemic grinds on, with the number of daily deaths rising and an increasingly frustrated White House urging Americans to get the booster to bolster their protection. Uptake remains low: Only 16 percent of people 5 and older and only 39 percent of those 65 and older, the most vulnerable group, have received the booster, according to the CDC.  The CDC and FDA described the early signal in a statement updating their websites Friday afternoon. The signal set off a debate among officials about whether and how to release the information. CDC officials argued for releasing it, while some other officials, including at the FDA, were concerned that putting out unconfirmed data would fuel anti-vaccine sentiment and scare older Americans into avoiding the boosters. Ultimately, the agencies decided to release the information in the hopes that transparency \u201cwill build confidence,\u201d said a CDC official.  The signal was detected in the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration involving the CDC and about a dozen health-care organizations with electronic health records on 12 million people. As part of routine monitoring for possible adverse events, officials noticed late last year that they were picking up indications of higher-than-expected stroke risk, officials said.  Among about 550,000 people 65 and older who had already been vaccinated and received a booster dose of the Pfizer bivalent vaccine, 130 people had strokes in the first three weeks after getting the shot. No deaths have been reported. That finding raised a question because it suggested that people who received the bivalent were more likely to have an ischemic stroke in the 21 days following vaccination compared with Days 22 through 42 following vaccination.  The findings prompted officials to look for similar findings. CDC officials conducted a different analysis in the Vaccine Safety Datalink system, using the same data but different methodology, and were not able to replicate the finding. Officials also searched other systems, including those of Medicare, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Pfizer\u2019s global surveillance network. Regulators in other countries, including Israel, also were consulted, but no evidence of similar findings emerged, the officials said.  The statement from the two agencies said that the government uses multiple systems to detect potential safety problems and that \u201coften these safety systems detect signals that could be due to factors other than the vaccine itself.\u201d  \u201cAlthough the totality of the data currently suggests that it is very unlikely that the signal \u2026 represents a true clinical risk,\u201d the statement said, \u201cwe believe it is important to share this information with the public.\u201d Kit Longley, a spokesman for Pfizer, said the company and its partner, BioNTech, have been made aware of the \u201climited reports\u201d of stroke. \u201cThere is no evidence to conclude that ischemic stroke is associated with the use of the companies\u2019 covid-19 vaccines,\u201d Longley said. He added that about 550 million doses of the companies\u2019 omicron-targeted bivalent shot have been delivered globally and about 30 million in the United States.  Safety experts say that safety signals occur frequently; if they don\u2019t, the system might not be sensitive enough. But there is a difference between signals and genuine safety risks. One of the reasons officials believe strongly there is not a safety risk is that they have not been able to come up with a plausible reason that such a problem would occur now \u2014 given the huge number of vaccines that have been administered worldwide since the end of 2020 \u2014 or why a problem would affect the Pfizer-BioNTech booster and not Moderna\u2019s. Both shots use mRNA technology.  Public health experts say it\u2019s important for the health agencies to be as transparent as possible about potential adverse events. If the information is not presented, public health agencies could be accused of hiding data. But such reports can be misinterpreted as causal when they are not.  The agencies said they will continue to evaluate data from the systems and will discuss the data and additional analyses at the FDA\u2019s previously scheduled Jan. 26 meeting with its vaccine advisers.  The Vaccine Safety Datalink has electronic health data that includes the kind of vaccine given to patients, the dates of vaccination and other vaccinations administered on the same day. It uses information on illnesses diagnosed at doctors\u2019 offices, in emergency rooms and in hospitals.  The system set up to monitor coronavirus vaccine safety is the most extensive in U.S. history.  In 2021, the system detected a link between the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and a rare but potentially deadly blood clotting and bleeding syndrome called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or TTS. The data prompted the FDA to impose new restrictions in May, saying only people who were unable or refusing to get other vaccines should receive the Johnson & Johnson shot.  There have also been concerns about the mRNA vaccines and the possible risk of a rare condition known as myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, in adolescent and young men. But federal health officials have said data shows that the known risks of covid-19 illness and its related, possibly severe complications far outweigh the potential risks.  In previous investigations of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and links to blood clots, and possible risks of myocarditis, officials found stronger signals as they searched additional safety databases. But that was not the case in this instance.  \u201cHere, as we continue to dig \u2026 it\u2019s disappearing rather than becoming stronger,\u201d the FDA official said.  TL;DR - The Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaborative project between CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office, integrated health care organizations, and networks across the U.S, picked up a possible sign that the Bivalent vaccine increases the risk of stroke in people 65 and older.  After searching through several large databases, including those from other countries like Israel, there was no evidence of similar findings. So the CDC's conclusion is the risk is extremely low to non-existent. They will continue to monitor.","score":"296","date":"Jan 15, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"tmkedmw","body":"US started Pfizer bivalent in Sep. Singapore started Pfizer bivalent on 12 Dec.

This panel of objective reviewers then votes on whether or not to recommend its approval. It is these independent advisors - including infectious disease experts and vaccinologists from Stanford, the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard - who are now raising concerns about the partial information shown to them during approval discussions for the bivalent booster.

But a deep dive into several large databases failed to confirm the preliminary information, leading federal health officials to conclude the risk is extremely low \u2014 and probably nonexistent, those officials said Friday.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose system detected the early signal, and the Food and Drug Administration, which also assesses vaccine safety, have decided there is no need to change the recommendation that everyone 6 months and older should stay up to date with their coronavirus vaccinations, including those 5 and older who are eligible for the updated booster, according to officials speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the agencies.  The early signal involved the bivalent booster \u2014 which targets the original virus and omicron subvariants and became available starting in September \u2014 made by Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech. It did not apply to Moderna\u2019s updated booster, officials said.  Government vaccine safety experts have combed through databases containing millions of records in the United States and consulted with regulators in other countries but have not found any indication that the statistical signal represents a clinical risk to patients. They said they would continue to analyze the data. \u201cWe have looked at the totality of the evidence, and there are no concerns at this time that this represents a true safety signal,\u201d an FDA official said.  The FDA official said the government\u2019s sensitive vaccine safety systems are like a radio with the volume turned up high. Sometimes, when listening, \u201clike with a radio, you are going to hear some static in the background,\u201d the official said, adding it does not mean someone is talking. Chances are \u201cthis is just static and not someone real talking.\u201d  The review is happening as the pandemic grinds on, with the number of daily deaths rising and an increasingly frustrated White House urging Americans to get the booster to bolster their protection. Uptake remains low: Only 16 percent of people 5 and older and only 39 percent of those 65 and older, the most vulnerable group, have received the booster, according to the CDC.  The CDC and FDA described the early signal in a statement updating their websites Friday afternoon. The signal set off a debate among officials about whether and how to release the information. CDC officials argued for releasing it, while some other officials, including at the FDA, were concerned that putting out unconfirmed data would fuel anti-vaccine sentiment and scare older Americans into avoiding the boosters. Ultimately, the agencies decided to release the information in the hopes that transparency \u201cwill build confidence,\u201d said a CDC official.  The signal was detected in the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration involving the CDC and about a dozen health-care organizations with electronic health records on 12 million people. As part of routine monitoring for possible adverse events, officials noticed late last year that they were picking up indications of higher-than-expected stroke risk, officials said.  Among about 550,000 people 65 and older who had already been vaccinated and received a booster dose of the Pfizer bivalent vaccine, 130 people had strokes in the first three weeks after getting the shot. No deaths have been reported. That finding raised a question because it suggested that people who received the bivalent were more likely to have an ischemic stroke in the 21 days following vaccination compared with Days 22 through 42 following vaccination.  The findings prompted officials to look for similar findings. CDC officials conducted a different analysis in the Vaccine Safety Datalink system, using the same data but different methodology, and were not able to replicate the finding. Officials also searched other systems, including those of Medicare, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Pfizer\u2019s global surveillance network. Regulators in other countries, including Israel, also were consulted, but no evidence of similar findings emerged, the officials said.  The statement from the two agencies said that the government uses multiple systems to detect potential safety problems and that \u201coften these safety systems detect signals that could be due to factors other than the vaccine itself.\u201d  \u201cAlthough the totality of the data currently suggests that it is very unlikely that the signal \u2026 represents a true clinical risk,\u201d the statement said, \u201cwe believe it is important to share this information with the public.\u201d Kit Longley, a spokesman for Pfizer, said the company and its partner, BioNTech, have been made aware of the \u201climited reports\u201d of stroke. \u201cThere is no evidence to conclude that ischemic stroke is associated with the use of the companies\u2019 covid-19 vaccines,\u201d Longley said. He added that about 550 million doses of the companies\u2019 omicron-targeted bivalent shot have been delivered globally and about 30 million in the United States.  Safety experts say that safety signals occur frequently; if they don\u2019t, the system might not be sensitive enough. But there is a difference between signals and genuine safety risks. One of the reasons officials believe strongly there is not a safety risk is that they have not been able to come up with a plausible reason that such a problem would occur now \u2014 given the huge number of vaccines that have been administered worldwide since the end of 2020 \u2014 or why a problem would affect the Pfizer-BioNTech booster and not Moderna\u2019s. Both shots use mRNA technology.  Public health experts say it\u2019s important for the health agencies to be as transparent as possible about potential adverse events. If the information is not presented, public health agencies could be accused of hiding data. But such reports can be misinterpreted as causal when they are not.  The agencies said they will continue to evaluate data from the systems and will discuss the data and additional analyses at the FDA\u2019s previously scheduled Jan. 26 meeting with its vaccine advisers.  The Vaccine Safety Datalink has electronic health data that includes the kind of vaccine given to patients, the dates of vaccination and other vaccinations administered on the same day. It uses information on illnesses diagnosed at doctors\u2019 offices, in emergency rooms and in hospitals.  The system set up to monitor coronavirus vaccine safety is the most extensive in U.S. history.  In 2021, the system detected a link between the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and a rare but potentially deadly blood clotting and bleeding syndrome called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or TTS. The data prompted the FDA to impose new restrictions in May, saying only people who were unable or refusing to get other vaccines should receive the Johnson & Johnson shot.  There have also been concerns about the mRNA vaccines and the possible risk of a rare condition known as myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, in adolescent and young men. But federal health officials have said data shows that the known risks of covid-19 illness and its related, possibly severe complications far outweigh the potential risks.  In previous investigations of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and links to blood clots, and possible risks of myocarditis, officials found stronger signals as they searched additional safety databases. But that was not the case in this instance.  \u201cHere, as we continue to dig \u2026 it\u2019s disappearing rather than becoming stronger,\u201d the FDA official said.  TL;DR - The Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaborative project between CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office, integrated health care organizations, and networks across the U.S, picked up a possible sign that the Bivalent vaccine increases the risk of stroke in people 65 and older.  After searching through several large databases, including those from other countries like Israel, there was no evidence of similar findings. So the CDC's conclusion is the risk is extremely low to non-existent. They will continue to monitor.","score":"296","date":"Jan 15, 2023","source":"hwz"},{"author":"tmkedmw","body":"US started Pfizer bivalent in Sep. Singapore started Pfizer bivalent on 12 Dec.

The Moderna booster shot, which can be given to those aged 18 and above, targets circulating variants more closely. The original mRNA vaccines largely target the wildtype virus, though they are still effective against Covid-19 variants, including Omicron.  Prof Mak stressed that the current vaccine is still effective in conferring protection, and that it is \"prudent\" for people to think about getting their vaccines as early as possible in light of a possible Covid-19 wave at the end of the year.  \"We've seen with our BA4.5 wave, it came a little bit earlier than what we originally were anticipating and therefore one could be caught off guard,\" he said.  It would therefore be best to get vaccinated, if eligible, as soon as possible, he stressed.  He noted that the delivery date for Moderna's new vaccine is still not confirmed, though MOH anticipates that it could be ready in the later part of the year - around the last quarter.  Health Minister Ong Ye Kung also said on Wednesday that a second booster dose is now recommended for people aged 60 and above.  He noted that almost 80 per cent of the population has received booster shots, a key reason why Singapore could ride through the current BA.5 wave without tightening safe management measures - and without having many severe cases, or hospitals being overwhelmed.  To prepare for a possible second wave, vaccination coverage will have to be expanded, said Mr Ong.  The Expert Committee for Covid-19 Vaccination recommends the second mRNA booster at least five months after the first booster dose.  Previously, those aged 80 years and older had been recommended to receive a second booster vaccine, and it was also offered to persons aged 50 to 79 years.  Prof Mak said that the first booster confers good protection against hospitalisation and severe Covid in people aged 60 to 79, and has helped the nation weather the current wave.  \"However, as it has been over a year since we administered the first booster to this age group, we expect the protection to gradually wane,\" he added.  Therefore, Singapore needs to keep its vaccinations up to date, to prepare for possible future infection waves which could come as early as the end of the year.  Latest evidence indicates that a second booster can further strengthen vaccine effectiveness against severe disease, increasing from 94 per cent to 97 per cent in those aged 70 to 79, and from 97 per cent to 98 per cent for those aged 60 to 69.  Prof Mak noted that people who are medically vulnerable are also encouraged to receive their second booster, which will continue to be available for those aged 50 to 59 years old.  Those eligible for their primary series vaccination, first booster or second booster may receive their doses by walking into any of the 10 Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVCs) located across the island.","score":"10,799","date":"Aug 24, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"KYZT2021","body":"zham arh zham non stop","score":"1,486","date":"Oct 11, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"Medicated Oil","body":"Got welcome party and balloons by Ah Ong ???","score":"26,566","date":"Oct 11, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"otakuflick","body":"Trust people now","score":"1,042","date":"Oct 11, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"peaceheart","body":"\u6211\u8981\u6253\u5341\u4e2a\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01","score":"15,727","date":"Oct 11, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"ChrisChamber","body":"No charge it's free because no one will take if must pay You can wait few more months to get your chance to take the vax.","score":"3,003","date":"Oct 11, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"mrclubbie","body":"ok, so what ? is it an achievement ? hit what kpi ?","score":"58,862","date":"Oct 11, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"desmond_yee1","body":"its not free as you paid with your taxes","score":"25,199","date":"Oct 11, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"maxmike","body":"Now unvaccinated also can dine in at hawkers centre and restaurants, so those vaccinated need to go booster shot to protect those unvaccinated?","score":"2,413","date":"Oct 11, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"SmokeBomb","body":"Got what flavour to choose arh??","score":"1,041","date":"Oct 11, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"bwaysaikryptonite","body":"how chiu noe theirs injected ish realli teh vaccine or something else ?","score":"1,963","date":"Oct 11, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"desmond_yee1","body":"why the article never mention how long before the protection will wane","score":"25,199","date":"Oct 11, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"ChrisChamber","body":"5 months la.

Vaccination centre staff, who wished to remain anonymous, said the number of people getting the vaccine have gone up significantly since the launch of the new jab.

Yes, for purposes of achieving minimum protection. So if you have an infection, followed by two mRNA shots, you have minimum protection. But beyond minimum protection, infection is not considered as a substitute for a shot to keep up-to-date with your vaccination.  To keep up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccination, if you are 50 years-old or older and have achieved minimum protection, you should receive an additional dose within 5 months to 1 year of the last vaccine dose.  Where do I go to get the bivalent vaccine? Can I go to a private clinic? The Moderna\/Spikevax bivalent vaccine will be available at our Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVC).  Persons aged 50 and above, or those yet to achieve minimum protection, may walk into any JTVC offering the Moderna\/Spikevax vaccines from 17 October 2022 onwards. You can refer toto locate the nearest JTVC.  Do note that while VaccineGoWhere website also lists the nearest private clinics administering COVID-19 vaccines, the bivalent vaccine will only be available at JTVCs for now.  Can I skip my second booster and go straight to the bivalent dose? Yes, you should. We have basically stopped counting boosters. You can just go receive the bivalent vaccine.  How safe is the updated bivalent vaccine? Clinical studies show it has the same safety profile as the original Moderna\/Spikevax mRNA vaccine, which has been administered over 3 million times locally. Serious adverse events (SAE) have been reported in about 6 in 100,000 vaccinations, and all have recovered or are recovering. HSA has also reported a declining rate of SAEs with further shots (i.e. even fewer have adverse reactions after taking boosters  compared to taking primary series).  How safe is it to vaccinate young children under 5 years old? Vaccination for children aged 6 months to 5 years with the Moderna\/Spikevax vaccine is safe. Common side effects (such as injection site pain, fatigue, headache) were observed less commonly than in adults and subside within 2-3 days. SAEs are rare, with no cases of anaphylaxis or pericarditis\/myocarditis observed in the clinical trial. To date, over a million doses have been administered in the US, with no safety concerns reported.","score":"8,202","date":"Oct 9, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"TurboBumbleBee","body":"Guys pls keep stepping forward for MAXIMUM PROTRACTION","score":"5,900","date":"Oct 9, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"peaceheart","body":"But pls dun overdose on other kinds of medicine even our fave paracetamol.

What does this mean for those who are thinking of whether to get a second booster? The Straits Times has the answers.  Q: How many doses of a Covid-19 vaccine am I now required to take?  Singapore now requires that people get two shots of an mRNA vaccine, with a booster dose administered at least five months after completing the primary series.  As part of the new approach, vaccination is based on being up to date, rather than on how many doses someone has had, similar to how influenza vaccinations are administered seasonally, MOH said on Friday.  Under this strategy, people will still have to get three doses of an mRNA vaccine for basic protection.  Also, those 50 and older - including those who have taken a second booster - should receive a booster shot between five months and a year from their last dose.  People will be considered up-to-date with their Covid-19 vaccinations if they have at least the minimum protection and their last vaccine dose was within the past year.  Q: What are bivalent vaccines and who should take them?  The Moderna bivalent vaccine approved by the Health Science Authority (HSA) in September targets the original Sars-CoV-2 strain of the virus as well as the Omicron BA.1 variant.  At the time, HSA said preliminary data suggested that the Moderna bivalent vaccine was also effective against the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants, and others such as the Delta and Gamma variants.  The Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccination has recommended the use of the bivalent vaccine to replace the existing formulation.  This means the original Moderna Spikevax vaccine will be replaced with the bivalent version starting next Monday, and made available for people aged 18 and above.  People aged 50 or older, as well as those who have yet to get basic protection against Covid-19, should have the bivalent vaccines, MOH said.  Pfizer's bivalent vaccine is still under evaluation, but is expected to be available in Singapore by the end of the year.  Q: I have already taken my primary series of two mRNA jabs and a booster shot. Do I still need to get additional shots of the Covid-19 vaccine?  A study by the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, published in February, showed that the effectiveness of mRNA boosters declined substantially after four months, suggesting the need for additional shots.  With new variants of the coronavirus expected to emerge with the approaching winter in the northern hemisphere, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said those eligible should get their shots.  MOH now recommends that only those 50 and above get a booster shot between five months and a year from the last dose, but it added that it will consider extending this recommendation to other age groups at a later date.  Q: Will non-mRNA vaccines still be available?  The Novavax\/Nuvaxovid vaccine remains available at the joint testing and vaccination centre in Bishan, as well as the Yishun and Jurong polyclinics.  The Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine was earlier available as a booster for only those medically ineligible to receive the mRNA and Novavax\/Nuvaxovid vaccines.  Now, people who have yet to receive a booster dose can be given the Sinovac vaccine as a booster, even if they are not medically ineligible for other vaccines.  However, the Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccination still recommends they consider taking either the mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech or the Novavax vaccine as a booster due to the better protection conferred.","score":"8,202","date":"Oct 11, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"kuti-kuti","body":"so is the Novava available in sg now still based on the old covid variant?","score":"9,801","date":"Oct 11, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"ahkrong","body":"LOLOLOLOLOLOL","score":"1,451","date":"Oct 11, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"Shdwfalcon","body":"Doubt the ministers will answer this question upfront.

This comes after registrations opened last week for parents and guardians to get their children, aged between six months and four years, to receive Moderna\u2019s Spikevax vaccine at one of five centres across the island, in areas such as Punggol, Tampines and Queenstown.  For those between six months and four years, the Moderna vaccine is given in two doses of 25 micrograms each, administered at least eight weeks apart.  The vaccination centre at One Punggol, which is operated by Thomson Medical, administered 53 doses of the vaccine to children between six months and four years in the first two hours.  Punggol is the town with the highest proportion of children aged below five, making up 8.3 per cent - or about 14,640 - of the estate\u2019s 176,190 residents last year, according to figures from the Singapore Department of Statistics for 2021.  The centre - which was filled with the sounds of children crying as they got their jabs - was decorated with pictures of cartoon characters on the walls of the vaccination counters.  Parents told The Straits Times that they wanted their children to get vaccinated to protect them against severe Covid-19, amid the current wave of infections due to the XBB Omicron sub-variant.","score":"14,152","date":"Oct 25, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"KYZT2021","body":"yea make sure before school re open","score":"1,486","date":"Oct 25, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"noobmaster89","body":"SINGAPORE - People are waiting longer - in some cases, up to more than an hour - for the new bivalent vaccine.  This comes amid a spike in the number of Covid-19 infections and as people make plans for their year-end getaways.  When The Straits Times on Monday visited four of the nine joint testing and vaccination centres (JTVCs) that offered the new jabs, the waiting times ranged from half an hour to two hours.   Vaccination centre staff, who wished to remain anonymous, said the number of people getting the vaccine have gone up significantly since the launch of the new jab.  At one of the centres, staff said nearly 500 people were given the vaccine by noon. This compares with the more than 100 shots given a day before the new vaccine was available. Mask-wearing was mandatory at all the centres.   \u201cI am not comfortable that there are so many cases but, at the same time, there are not a lot of severe cases,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is still relatively safe to go around.\u201d  Mr Calvin Goh, 58, who went to the Ang Mo Kio JTVC as he lives nearby, is worried that Covid-19 restrictions will return if the number of cases continues to rise.  \u201cOur customers are just starting to come back. If we close down again, it will affect business badly,\u201d said Mr Goh, who is in business development.  Approved by the Health Sciences Authority in September, the Moderna bivalent vaccine is made to protect people against the original strain of the virus and the Omicron variant - the reason why Mr Goh took the new jab.  The Ministry of Health said the current wave of Covid-19 infections is expected to peak at an average of 15,000 daily cases by about mid-November.     For retiree Steven Koh, 55, who got his shot because he lives with his parents who are in their 80s, there was no need to queue because he had an appointment at the Ang Mo Kio JTVC.  Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said in a press conference last Saturday that if there is high demand for vaccines, JTVCs may be open every day from this week.  Those who have yet to receive minimum protection (the equivalent of three mRNA doses), or those aged 50 and above and whose last Covid-19 vaccine jab was at least five months ago, can walk into any of the nine of the JTVCs for the bivalent shot without making an appointment. Only the Bishan centre does not offer it.  People can refer toto locate the nearest JTVC and their operating hours.

But only a select group are likely to benefit, and the evidence to date doesn\u2019t support the view that a bivalent vaccine containing omicron or its subvariants is better than the monovalent vaccine. The CDC risks eroding the public\u2019s trust by overselling the new shot.  The existingandmRNA vaccines were designed to protect against theof the novel coronavirus, known as Wuhan-1. The strain that left China, however, was D614G, the first variant. Between January 2020 and December 2021, D614G was replaced by the alpha variant then the delta variant. At the end of 2021, Oxford conducted ato determine whether the mRNA vaccines still provided protection against severe illness and death caused by the variants. They did.  Then things changed. At the end of 2021, the omicron variant (BA.1) and its subvariants (BA.2, BA.3, BA.4 and BA.5) supplanted delta. Not only was omicron more contagious than delta; it also evaded immunity. Even the fully vaccinated were at risk of mild illness, and some of severe illness. A third dose was recommended, then a fourth. The CDCthat both a third and fourth dose reduced hospitalizations.  But not everyone benefited. Those who did fell into: the elderly, people with serious health problems and people who were immunocompromised. As the CDC launches its fall booster dose campaign, it would be wise to focus on those at risk rather than the young and healthy.  The new bivalent vaccine contains mRNA from the ancestral strain and BA.4 and BA.5, the subvariants that account for virtually all currently circulating SARS-CoV-2. How does it compare with the old monovalent one? We don\u2019t know for sure, because the Food and Drug Administration authorized the new shot without clinical trials. (As a member of the FDA Vaccine Advisory Committee, I voted against the authorization.) But in June Pfizer and Moderna presented data on bivalent vaccines containing the ancestral strain plus BA.1. Those shots were properly studied, and the results were underwhelming.  Participants who had received three doses of the original vaccine were given a fourth dose of the original vaccine or the bivalent one. The virus-neutralizing antibody responses against BA.1 were greater following the bivalent vaccine, but not at a level that was likely to be clinically significant.  Booster doses for Moderna\u2019s vaccine contained half an adult dose each of the ancestral vaccine and BA.1. Moderna will be giving two vaccines at booster doses typically given to children. So will Pfizer.  Most worrisome, Moderna recently published aon the clinical efficacy of the bivalent vaccine containing BA.1. Sixteen cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred: 11 in the bivalent group and five in the monovalent group. For those who suffered clinical illness, five were in the bivalent group and one in the monovalent group. In other words, although the numbers were small, the monovalent vaccine performedthan the bivalent vaccine.  Heading into the fall, it would make sense to boost those at greatest risk of hospitalization with Covid-19. We should be careful, however, about overselling the bivalent vaccine as something better than the existing vaccine until more data are available.","score":"252","date":"Oct 18, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"Earthling","body":"40mins nia, where got 2hrs","score":"556","date":"Oct 18, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"bubba8","body":"There's a reason why Big Pharma loves uniquely SG!","score":"252","date":"Oct 18, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"PoloBoiBoi","body":"did u MIA from edmw since the start of the pandemic???","score":"4,262","date":"Oct 18, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"AuraKUPO","body":"Will have many chance, don't gan chiong","score":"5,037","date":"Oct 18, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"televisione","body":"Waiting to get my 172th shot during 2030","score":"835","date":"Oct 18, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"EdenHazard","body":"Wow five mrna satki siol","score":"4,223","date":"Oct 18, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"Intel888","body":"Reminds me of a physics class I attended a long, long time ago.

Students at North American universities risk disenrollment due to third dose COVID-19 vaccine mandates. We present a risk-benefit assessment of boosters in this age group and provide five ethical arguments against mandates. We estimate that 22,000 - 30,000 previously uninfected adults aged 18-29 must be boosted with an mRNA vaccine to prevent one COVID-19 hospitalisation.  :  per COVID-19 hospitalisation prevented in previously uninfected young adults, we anticipate 18 to 98 serious adverse events, including 1.7 to 3.0 booster-associated myocarditis cases in males, and 1,373 to 3,234 cases of grade \u22653 reactogenicity which interferes with daily activities. Given the high prevalence of post-infection immunity, this risk-benefit profile is even less favourable.  University booster mandates are unethical because:  1) no formal risk-benefit assessment exists for this age group;  2) vaccine mandates may result in a net expected harm to individual young people;  3) mandates are not proportionate: expected harms are not outweighed by public health benefits given the modest and transient effectiveness of vaccines against transmission;  4) US mandates violate the reciprocity principle because rare serious vaccine-related harms will not be reliably compensated due to gaps in current vaccine injury schemes; and  5) mandates create wider social harms.  We consider counter-arguments such as a desire for socialisation and safety and show that such arguments lack scientific and\/or ethical support. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our analysis for current 2-dose CCOVIDovid-19 vaccine mandates in North America.","score":"252","date":"Sep 13, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"Libbis","body":"Experts of AI, says that vds is most likely after F1.","score":"1,339","date":"Sep 13, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"MiG123","body":"they just believe whatever governments\/authorities say must be right and can't possibly be against the people's interest, even if PAP says cyanide or lead is good for health they'll believe.  its not solely a SG phenomena, these days 'educated' just means someone who's very well trained\/indoctrinated to obediently obey instructions from those in power...","score":"6,565","date":"Sep 13, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"flatterylies","body":"i hope LW will fix this oyk soon. else nobody is alive to vote for him","score":"1,520","date":"Sep 13, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"Smtsai","body":"Don\u2019t worry sinkies uplorry will have more \u201csinkies\u201d get it .. its a never ending cycle","score":"2,142","date":"Sep 13, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"Ev0d3vil","body":"KNN get rid of the stupid VDS la.","score":"4,151","date":"Sep 13, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"Smtsai","body":"Cannot your babies havent take 5 shots not the time yet.","score":"2,142","date":"Sep 13, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"flatterylies","body":"why Singaporeans cannot have any say on this ah? why we must let the Govt control so much esp this is on our health leh. now they are touching our kids too . what can we do?","score":"1,520","date":"Sep 13, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"banbleh","body":"If you've encountered ball carriers before u'd know that they only know how to ball carry and saboh others, no other skills.

He added:  \"This is the nature of crisis management. We stand down many measures when it's not needed, but we need to keep some in anticipation of something worse happening later.\"  In a supplementary question, Jamus Lim of the Workers' Party questioned if the public sector would consider a complete removal of VDS.  \"So I understand the desire by the ministry to allow the private sector to retain maximum flexibility in terms of vaccination-differentiated measures. But I'm wondering if the public sector will move toward a complete removal? And I ask in part because I believe many of us do have residents that for religious, health or personal reasons, who have chosen not to be vaccinated.\"  Ong responded that it would be difficult to adopt a \"blanket policy\" by removing VDS requirements for the entire public sector, as such measures are dependent on the settings.  \"It depends on whether it is crowded, whether seniors are present in those settings, what is the risk of transmission. So I think we always need to take a differentiated approach.\"  As Covid-19 becomes endemic, daily life has to be adjusted in order to live with the virus, and Ong believed that \"according to the risks of different settings, we adopt the necessary measures to manage the risk\".

Among other things, it was alleged that: (a) Dr Yang sent WhatsApp messages containing unverified and misleading information on COVID-19 in a chatgroup (\u201cChatgroup\u201d) with a total of 206 participants; and (b) in these messages, Dr Yang made misleading and untruthful claims on the efficacy of Ivermectin in treating and preventing COVID-19 and had also promoted the use of Ivermectin to treat and prevent COVID-19. In particular, Dr Yang falsely claimed to have prescribed Ivermectin to his patients who were suffering from COVID-19 (when he did not actually do so) and that these patients had thereafter exited the hospital\u2019s Intensive Care Unit and High Dependency Unit within three days.  2. The Information was subsequently referred to an Interim Orders Committee (\u201cIOC\u201d) to determine if it was necessary for the protection of members of the public, or was otherwisei n the public interest, or was in the interests of Dr Yang that his registration be suspended or be made subject to conditions or restrictions, pending the conclusion of the relevant proceedings under Part VII of the Medical Registration Act (\u201cMRA\u201d).  3. An independent Complaints Committee was appointed to inquire into the Information. Investigations by the Complaints Committee are currently ongoing.  4. On 9 March 2022, the IOC, upon due inquiry into the Information referred to it by the SMC and after considering the submissions by Counsel for the SMC and Counsel for Dr Yang, was satisfied that, pursuant to section 59B(1)(b) of the MRA, it was necessary for the protection of members of the public and in the public interest that with effect from 9 March 2022, Dr Yang\u2019s registration as a medical practitioner is to be subject to the following conditions or restrictions, for a period of 18 months or until the conclusion of the proceedings against Dr Yang under Part VII of the MRA, whichever is sooner:  (b) Dr Yang must not use any websites, social media platforms or closed messaging systems to put forward or share any views on the following matters:  (c) To the extent that is reasonably practicable, Dr Yang must seek to remove any posts or messages from any websites, social media platforms or closed messaging systems that he is responsible for or has shared relating to his views on the following matters: (d) Dr Yang must not:  (e) Dr Yang must not recommend, prescribe, supply or administer Ivermectin to any patient without the prior approval of a fully registered medical practitioner with a valid practising certificate, whose approval, Medical Council Registration Number and signature must be recorded electronically or in writing;  (f) If Dr Yang recommends, prescribes, supplies or administers Ivermectin to a patient pursuant to the conditions set out in (e) above, Dr Yang must keep a log of all patients to whom he has recommended, prescribed or administered Ivermectin to, the details of the approving medical practitioner, and he must submit this log to the SMC within five calendar days of such recommendation, prescription, supply or administration;  and (g) Dr Yang must inform any organisation or person employing him for medical work that his registration is subject to the above conditions.","score":"252","date":"Sep 14, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"jericho75","body":"U only hire that person to perform duties according to Job scopes which is office hours.

The daily limit on tourists will be raised to 50,000 people as soon as next month from the current 20,000, broadcaster FNN reported, citing unidentified government officials. Authorities are also considering a gradual easing of testing requirements, such as initially exempting fully vaccinated people, the Nikkei newspaper reported earlier. Travellers currently need to submit negative results from a PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure to Japan.  Before the pandemic, the country known for its vibrant cities and unique culture was in the midst of a tourism boom, with inbound visitors reaching a record in 2019. Airlines, hotels and retailers are all eager to regain the business they lost. The small trickle of foreigners allowed into Japan last year spent 120 billion yen (S$1.2 billion). In 2019, they spent 4.8 trillion yen, or 40 times more, according to the Japan Tourism Agency.   Airline shares rose in Tokyo trading on the news, with Japan Airlines climbing as much as 3.5 per cent. ANA Holdings gained 2.1 per cent.  An initiative started 3 months ago, with limited fanfare, started letting in a small number of tourists. But the associated restrictions - including mandatory mask-wearing, temperature checks and limited free movement - as well as the tests-to-enter requirements, have made it difficult to attract visitors.  The ongoing curbs compare with places like Australia, Singapore and the UK, which impose few if any restrictions to entry now, and are getting a head start in reviving their beleaguered tourism industries.","score":"68","date":"Aug 23, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"concreteman","body":"\"The government is also set to open Japan to more foreign tourists by allowing unguided tours -- ones not accompanied by tour conductors -- after the country on June 10 started processing applications for accepting foreign visitors on guided package tours from 98 countries and regions deemed low-risk for coronavirus transmission.\"","score":"32","date":"Aug 23, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"Squeezer","body":"The airlines seem to know in advance when they started adding flights.","score":"68","date":"Aug 23, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"KyushuWoozy","body":"To reduce the burden on public health centers and medical institutions, simplification of HER-SYS (Hersys) input, establishment of nationwide health follow-up centers, and over-the-counter (OTC) test kits: drugs that can be purchased without a doctor's prescription.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is expected to announce the changes in the coming days.  The latest easing of Japan's entry rules -- the toughest in the Group of Seven advanced economies -- is expected to take place in October, though the final decision will depend on the COVID-19 situation at home and abroad.  The government is looking to take advantage of fall travel demand at a time when aboosts international travelers' buying power in Japan.  After the change, Japan will not require visas for short-term travelers from the U.S. and certain other countries. Japan will also scrap the daily entry cap of 50,000 people.  Qualifying travelers are expected to have to meet certain conditions, such as vaccination status.  Japan's latest wave of COVID-19 infections has ebbed, encouraging Tokyo's move faster on relaxing border rules -- an area where Singapore, Thailand and other Asian destinations have a head start.  \"It's important for us to work to strengthen Japan's earning power, taking advantage of the current yen weakness,\" Kishida said Wednesday during a meeting of the government's Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy.  Japan imposed a near full ban on new entries by foreigners in November last year. In March, the government started allowing supervised entry for students and business travelers, then opened up guided group travel for tourists in June.","score":"4,999","date":"Sep 17, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"concreteman","body":"so , its Tuesday morning for the announcement ?","score":"32","date":"Sep 17, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"freshvibes","body":"Looking forward to some positive news.","score":"2,251","date":"Sep 17, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"twosix","body":"Source:","score":"1,445","date":"Sep 18, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"luckygal","body":"On FB keep seeing people post a table of countries which do not need visa.

To buy the wakuwari (20% discount) main entry tickets, you can only do so through USJ's japanese website. Like whathas mentioned, you could consider buying just the main entry through the japanese website (with signing up a Club USJ membership with Japanese inputs for name, address and etc) and then the express pass through the USJ's english website.  However, there are some issues with that. 1. USJ's japanese website is unable to process overseas credit card. I've tried my Revolut and various banks' CC and can't complete the transaction.  2. USJ's english website does not have all the variety of Express Passes that its japanese site offers. Good if what you want is available on english website. I suspect that the timed entry combinations are limited too on the english website. just guessing.  From my online search, it seems like there are foreign travellers (on reddit) who were able to complete their purchases with Apple Pay. However, when I attempted to try it, I found out that Apple Pay option is only available on USJ's english website, and not on the japanese website. Based on the reddit comments and what I've experienced,(I stopped at the payment page. Did not follow through the USJ english website with Apple Pay)  Also, just to highlight, in my google search results with the error codes from the failed process, some travellers (on some japanese page; likely domestic travellers) called their bank to \"loosen\" the security. I tried to contact Revolut to see if there is anything they could do, which I was told there is nothing for them to do, as there is not even a transaction rejection or attempt to Revolut. With this, I conclude that the comments in this case does not apply to international buyers.  The optimum priced and flexible tickets option is on USJ japanese website and you are.  With all that, I still managed to buy my USJ tickets with Express Passes, through the USJ japanese website (coz I'm desperate for the 20% wakuwari discount and the flex in Express Passes choices).  What I did was at thepayment page, Iand managed to get help from a friend who was travelling in Japan, to(7-11 specifically, as only this konbini allows credit card payment) within 2 days of the tickets purchase (deadline is given and will be stated after completing the purchase on USJ japanese website).  The QR codes for the tickets will be released to you after payment is made.  Sorry but the solution presented may not be ideal but I could not find any better alternatives to the best outcome.  Maybe if any bros in HWZ who are already there in Japan now, can help the bros here? lol  Another alternative is Klook. Their main entry tickets are more expensive (no wakuwari discount option; even normal pass tickets are more expensive than what was sold on USJ website). Their express passes surprisingly is slightly cheaper (few dollars) than what was sold on USJ japanese website, however, it is limited in variety options and you are unable to choose your desired timed entry combinations (supposedly randomly allocated as indicated in their T&Cs).","score":"17","date":"Oct 29, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"kennysme","body":"In Japan got a lot of domestic tourists right now because their gahmen gave them money for spending.

I didn't book oversized luggage space for my trip from Tokyo to Kyoto.  The family that booked the last row of seats didn't use the luggage space behind their seats so we just happily inserted our 28inch luggage within the space.  The train attendants came by and told us that we cannot just place our luggage behind the last row without an oversized luggage booking.  Thankfully I had the green class tickets and the train attendants assisted in rebooking us on a different cabin with luggage space available.  Apparently, you need to book the last row seats of each cabin to store your oversized luggages.

When I put on the overhead cabin, it only comes out a little bit. I estimate the overhead cabin has a width of around 40-45cm deep.  So, a 50cm width luggage can easily fit on overhead cabin.  Now the problem is, how heavy is your luggage? Can you easily bring it up to overhead cabin?  I pack light, even brought a winter jacket which I only used for 2 days. When I took shinkansen, it's packed in the luggage. My check-in luggage was only around 9-10kg with the winter jacket inside so carrying it up is not a problem.  Now, with more travellers coming in and if you want to take advantage of JR Pass, you may not necessarily have the last row as the number is limited. Lagi worse if you travel with family and each have one luggage. The Kodama\/Hikari may only run once or twice per hour depending on timing. Another to consider is how flexible is your schedule.

The 80cm height is inclusive of wheels.  80x50x30 is just a guide as it is just a proportional measurement that fits 160cm total. If your luggage is 90x40x30, you also dun require a reservation for the last row.  Best is you go measure the 3 dimensions and see if okay.

Researchers at Columbia University and the University of Michigan compared the levels of protective proteins, called neutralizing antibodies, in blood samples from 21 people who got a fourth shot of the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech SE bivalent boosters against antibody levels in 19 people who got four shots of the original vaccines.  Three to five weeks after a fourth shot, those people who received the new boosters aimed at BA.4 and BA.5 variants \u201chad similar neutralizing antibody titers as those receiving a fourth monovalent mRNA vaccine,\u201d the authors conclude in a manuscripton the preprint server bioRxiv.org. This held true for antibodies that protect against BA.4, BA.5 and older variants such as the original omicron strain, according to the study.  Modernarose 2.7% to $136.57 at the close in New York trading. Pfizer stock was little changed.  The results don\u2019t mean that getting a bivalent shot has no benefit, and it will need to be confirmed in much larger studies. However, they raise the question of whether the switch to a new version of the vaccine was necessary.  The results also contrast sharply with an Oct. 13from Pfizer and BioNTech touting \u201cpositive early data\u201d from a clinical trial suggesting that its bivalent vaccine \u201cis anticipated to provide better protection.\u201d The statement was based on data collected from subjects in the first seven days after immunization, and the company has not yet released details.  \u201cSo far we don\u2019t see the benefit\u201d of the bivalent shots over the old ones, said study senior author David Ho, a virologist who heads the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at Columbia University. A clear difference between the boosters could emerge over longer periods of time, he said in a telephone interview. It could also turn out that a second booster shot with the bivalent vaccine may be needed, he said.  Ho said that the study has been submitted for publication in a scientific journal.  Rollout of the bivalent vaccines has been slow so far. Only about 20 million Americans have received the latest version of the vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The lackluster results for bivalent boosters could be due to a phenomenon called imprinting, Ho said. That means that the immune system most strongly remembers the first version of a virus it encounters. After it mutates, the response to a vaccine -- even one targeting newer strains -- may still be tilted toward fighting the original pathogen.  Ho said he personally has gotten four doses of the original generation of mRNA shots, and that he is waiting for more data to roll in to decide what to do about a fifth dose.  Pfizer declined to comment on outside research. A spokesperson said the company would reveal additional 30-day data on its bivalent shot in the coming weeks. Moderna didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.  In early October, Moderna researchers published data from the clinical trial of a different bivalent booster that is tailored to the original omicron strain. That study, in the, found that a fourth shot of that bivalent vaccine produced higher levels of antibodies compared to four shots of Moderna\u2019s original vaccine. Moderna\u2019s bivalent vaccine against the original omicron strain, called mRNA-1273.214, is not authorized in the U.S., but has been cleared for use in numerous countries including the UK and Canada.

The bivalent mRNA vaccine targets the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as the, such as BA.1, BA.4\/5. Because of the immune evasion properties of the Omicron variants, this updated vaccine will have better protection against COVID-19. They remain well tolerated and the safety profile remains consistent with the previous version of the same vaccines, with mostly. With the increase in coverage against the new variants and a good safety profile, the decision to receive the fourth jab should be clear. But official vaccination statistics suggest that this isn\u2019t so. Health Ministry data shows that 81 per cent of the population have what is known as a minimum vaccination protection, referring to those who have taken three mRNA oror four Sinovac doses. However, the percentage of the population with up-to-date vaccination is only 61 per cent. A person is considered up-to-date with their vaccination if they have the minimum protection and their last jab was within one year. While we do not have data on the bivalent vaccine uptake, we can infer using the previous set of data that there were fewer individuals getting vaccines over the last year, which could be the fourth booster. Why is this so? A person receiving a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at Tanjong Pagar Community Centre on Jan 27, 2021.

To understand deeper, we must consider the intrinsic and extrinsic factors an individual considers when deciding whether to receive the vaccine. The intrinsic factor is about weighing the personal risk of being infected against the personal costs of getting the vaccine. During the height of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, thewas high as most of the population was not vaccinated. The emergence of variants such as the Delta and Omicron variants took advantage of our immune-naive population and caused multiple surges and spikes in infection. The risk of being infected was much higher than the personal costs of getting the vaccine. In short, the benefit of vaccination greatly outweighed any other considerations during that time. In 2022, these considerations are very different. The risk of infection for an individual is likely to be lower when most of the population is vaccinated and has some post-infection immunity. The disease pattern has changed as well, with most cases now being categorised as mild to moderate with very fewand deaths. So, the perceived personal risk is lower. Meanwhile, the personal costs of getting the vaccine are rising. As more of the workforce are encouraged to, this would mean people have to plan their schedules in advance to make time and head over to vaccination centres or clinics. Parents would need extra childcare arrangements should they only be able to schedule their vaccination appointments later in the day. And there is a possibility of having adverse effects from the vaccination which requires a few days of rest and complicates scheduling even further. All of these are personal costs and will disincentivise individuals from getting the vaccine. It might seem trivial compared to being infected with COVID-19, but for many, these are practical, day-to-day challenges they face.

We subconsciously respond to these cues, which play a part in our decision-making process. Singapore\u2019s response to the pandemic has adjusted as the nation transitioned from 2020 to 2022. Opening borders for travellers,such as limited crowd capacity in enclosed spaces,and vaccine-differentiated measures are all steps in this transition, but they are also environmental cues for changes in behaviour. It does not mean the virus is eradicated or is less transmissible, but they are perceived to be because of these cues, and this again affects how we evaluate our personal risk. With the message of COVID-19 now being a manageable and preventable disease, we have less incentive to maintain that high alert we had two years ago. Behavioural changes also spread from one to another, so we are more inclined to follow the crowd as time goes by. As our risk profile and behaviour changed, our decision-making process changed as well. This includes the decision to get the fourth jab, which now could be a low priority after evaluating the personal risk and the high personal cost together with all the external cues we receive as a society. How do we then change this process of decision-making so that uptake of the fourth dose increases? And why is the additional booster important, if we have discussed that the risk of infection is now lower and the disease itself is manageable and preventable? The immune system is a complex mechanism of many moving parts, but we know immunity levels wane as time passes. With the threat of emerging new COVID-19 variants, a fourth dose will be very helpful to keep population immunity high, not only to protect ourselves but also our vulnerable population. The concept ofis not new to any of us, with influenza vaccination given twice yearly as an example due to the change in strains circulating the world. But we need to communicate this effectively and consistently to the public. Public service announcements, education and awareness through community leaders and healthcare providers are one of the many ways to effectively communicate with the public. The science around COVID-19 changes rapidly. We should not be afraid to acknowledge this, but instead, adapt it into our communication strategies to educate and empower the public with new information when available. For example, we now know ventilation is a crucial component of transmission, so communicating this aspect to improve ventilation in office buildings and other enclosed spaces will help people manage their risk evaluation. The language we use is equally important. Previously we used \u201ccompleted vaccination\u201d but now it is \u201cup-to-date vaccination\u201d. These are small but important changes in language that will also change perception and behaviour. Barriers to vaccination also need to be constantly lowered. Several measures that could be implemented are protected time orto make arrangements to get the vaccine, and even an extra day or two off after to recover from potential adverse effects. Extended childcare services will help parents tremendously in arranging their schedules. Wider options for vaccination locations can be provided, such as community pharmacies so it is always accessible, thus reducing personal costs as discussed earlier.  Vaccines have been an incredible life-saving tool for decades and the development of COVID-19 vaccines has been one of the turning points in the. We still have much to learn about the virus and disease, and what we know today will likely change in the future when presented with new data and evidence. This new knowledge will inform new public health policies and interventions. But it is equally important to understand that public perception and behaviours change based on new information. Environmental cues will also affect how personal decisions are made. Keeping this in mind, we can communicate more efficiently and effectively so that decisions are made accurately.","score":"7,236","date":"Dec 2, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"tmkedmw","body":"Pofma'able.

Instead it will use a new definition to determine if a person is up-to-date with their vaccination. Under the new \"up-to-date\" definition, everyone should adhere to the latest vaccination recommendations by the ministry, said MOH.  This arrangement is similar to the Government\u2019s stance on flu vaccinations, where individuals are advised to be vaccinated periodically to protect themselves against new Influenza strains, said MOH.  As part of the latest recommendations for Covid-19 vaccinations, people should adhere to two key recommendations, said the ministry.  Firstly, they should ensure that they have achieved minimum protection against Covid-19.  This means that those aged five years old and above should either complete three mRNA or Novavax\/Nuvaxovid vaccination doses, or four Sinovac-CoronaVac doses in order to achieve minimum protection.  Secondly, those aged 50 and above should receive an additional booster dose between five months to a year from their last dose. The ministry recommended that those in this age group take the updated bivalent vaccine for their booster shots.  \"Individuals will be considered up-to-date with their Covid-19 vaccination if they have received at least the minimum protection and their last vaccine dose was received within the past one year,\u201d said the ministry.  This ministry said it will consider extending the second recommendation to other age groups at a later date.  BIVALENT VACCINES  The original Moderna\/Spikevax vaccines will be replaced with an updated, bivalent version that protects against original and subsequent strains of the virus.  The replacement, which will kick in from Oct 17, will apply to everybody aged 18 years and above who are receiving the Moderna\/Spikevax vaccine.  This follows the recommendation by the Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccination to replace the current formulation with the bivalent vaccine, said MOH.  \u201cThis updated bivalent vaccine will provide better protection against newer Covid-19 variants,\u201d said MOH.  The ministry also said that those aged 50 and above, or have yet to achieve minimum protection against the virus should take the bivalent vaccines. They can do so by going to any Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres offering the Moderna\/Spikevax vaccines from Oct 17.  The Pfizer\/Comirnaty bivalent vaccine is undergoing evaluation and is expected to be available by the end of this year, added the ministry.","score":"8,202","date":"Oct 7, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"Medicated Oil","body":"He want to prove himself wrong.","score":"26,566","date":"Dec 26, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"tatsit","body":"yeah its true. all the unvaxxed were dead already","score":"10,570","date":"Dec 26, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"bubba8","body":"Key pts  Among 51011 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the bivalent COVID-19 vaccine booster was 30% effective in preventing infection, during the time when the virus strains dominant in the community were represented in the vaccine.  \u201cThe association of increased risk of COVID-19 with higher numbers of prior vaccine doses in our study, was unexpected.\"  \u201cThis is not the only study to find a possible association with more prior vaccine doses and higher risk of COVID-19.\u201d  \"Another study found that receipt of two or three doses of a mRNA vaccine following prior COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk of reinfection than receipt of a single dose\"","score":"252","date":"Dec 26, 2022","source":"hwz"},{"author":"McGraw","body":"uncle ah..no need rat test, I confirm you are not a rat.
